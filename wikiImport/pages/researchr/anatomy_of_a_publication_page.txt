h1. Anatomy of a publication page
(about [[start|researchr]])

{{pages:researchr_anatomy_of_a_publication_page1.png}}

I use a number of different namespaces to keep the information displayed on a publication page. The main url for any publication is :ref:citekey, for example [[:ref:scardamalia2006knowledge|:ref:scardamalia2006knowledge]]. This displays the page above. However, if you click on edit, you will find a very minimal page. This is because I use the [[http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:include|include plugin]] to include pages from other namespaces:
  * notes:citekey holds the "Key Ideas" that I manually add
  * clip:citekey holds highlights and notes automatically exported by Skim
  * skimg:citekey holds links to images automatically exported by Skim
  * kindle:citekey holds highlights and notes automatically converted from Kindle

In addition to these included pages, I use the [[http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:backlinks|backlinks plugin]] to display all pages that link to this publication. I use bibtex-ruby and citeproc-ruby to parse the BibTeX citation and display at the top of the page. I use the [[http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:hidden|hidden plugin]] to provide access to the entire BibTeX citation. Finally, I provide links to
  * BibDesk - opens the citation in BibDesk, using the bibdesk: URL scheme
  * PDF - opens the PDF in Skim, using the skimx: URL scheme (in the Skim notes, there are also direct links to each individual page)
  * Sidewiki - opens the notes: and clip: pages side-by-side, so that I can easily go through the notes imported from Skim, and compile them into Key Ideas
