(about [[start|researchr]])

The concept of citekeys is really key to researchr, it's the glue that binds all the different applications together. A citekey is a unique key for each publication. These can be generated automatically by BibDesk, and I've chosen to use the formula //last name of first author + year + first word of title (more than three letters)//, so for example the citation:

<blockquote>Scardamalia, M., & Bereiter, C. (2006). Knowledge building: Theory, pedagogy, and technology. In K. Sawyer (Ed.), (Tran.), The Cambridge handbook of the learning sciences (97â€“118). New York: Cambridge University Press.</blockquote>

gets the citekey //scardamalia2006knowledge//. By knowing this citekey, I can easily look up the full citation in BibDesk, or from a text file (to insert into another program). I know that the PDF is in the BibDesk folder as scardamalia2006knowledge.pdf. I know that the main DokuWiki page is at ref:scardamalia2006knowledge, and that other relevant pages are at 
  * clip:scardamalia2006knowledge
  * kindle:scardamalia2006knowledge
  * skimg:scardamalia2006knowledge
 etc (see [[anatomy of a publication page]]).
