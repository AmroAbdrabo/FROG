h1. Key ideas

h2. Basic idea
A network of handheld computers, teacher controlling everything like a director in a play - very strong **theatre metaphor**, with "staging", "lights", "props", "backstage" etc. 

Importance of capturing **ephemeral processes** for analysis and sharing. (//"act becomes artefact"//)

h2. Link between physical and CSCL
Designing, implementing, and monitoring these learning activities is a workflow challenge, as research in teacher cognition, planning, and learning has highlighted (e.g., Borko & Putnam, 1996; Cohen et al.. 1993; Hammond & Sykes. 2001; Little & McLaughlin, 1993).

Teachers currently plan and manage these efforts using a broad array of documents and physical resources, including 
  * class lists
  * publishers' teacher activity guides
  * seat-based distribution of textbook instructions or photocopied materials
  * physical separation of groups in the classroom space
  * worksheets to be completed
  * informal observations of equitable participation by students in discussions

h2. Model
  * actors (including teacher, students, bots)
  * data objects
  * interaction networks (flows of information, workflows?)

(seems similar to ELOs etc)

h2. Agency
System seems extremely controlled by teacher - very little focus on self-organizing among students, agency etc.

h2. Adaptability
Focus on contingent/adaptive teaching, like in [@debarger2010teaching], enabling teacher to quickly assess students and collaboration, and change teaching approach on the fly.

h2. Information processing function
At a modeling level of description, classroom activity can be defined as an information processing function having an input, an output, and a process by which the output is to be generated from the input This functional definition of an activity can be used to model activities including
  * IRE sequences
  * role-playing activities (such as participatory simulations)
  * small group project-based work
  * seatwork or homework exercises

h2. Scripts
Mentions an implementation of Initiation-Response-Evaluation related to a global earth science project. 

Automatic implementation of "jigsaw-style" interaction, through saved network topologies.
