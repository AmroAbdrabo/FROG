h1. Key ideas

h2. What does "distance" mean?

The idea that there are conventional criteria for a "distance education" course which can all be transgressed, see illustration at the bottom. 

Could also be pedagogical aspect of teacher-learner transaction.

::No discussion of other students, I guess students didn't interact so much with each other back then?::

h3. Transactional distance
Moore and Kearsley (1996): increasing communication gap between teacher and learner, presence or absence of dialogue, extent to which predetermined structure is built into learning activity. 

High structure + low dialogue = high transactional distance

Low transactional distance = continuous dialogue with instructor

::Is this similar to my idea of "granularity of collaboration?:: Not sure how this applies to self-learning / peer collaboration contexts. Similar to [[:Monologic And Dialogic Learning|dialogue/monologue]]?

h2. Learner independence
Does the learner need more independence to deal with a high level of structure, or the opposite, an absence of structure? 

h2. Meaning making/knowing
<blockquote (Kegan, 1982, pp. 18-19)>Meaning is, in its origins, a physical activity (grasping, seeing), a social activity (it requires another), a survival activity (in doing it, we live). Meaning, understood in this way, is the primary human motion, irreducible.</blockquote>

Act of learning = (the) fundamental psychological impulse
