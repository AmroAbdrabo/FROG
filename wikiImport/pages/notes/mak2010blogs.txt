h1. Key ideas

h2. Research

h3. Topic
  * Connectivism and Connective Knowledge (CCK08) (Sep-Dec 2008)
    * 2200 registered participants, 150 remained active
  * survey, e-mail interview, look at statements in posts

h3. Question
Participants' preference for [[:blogs]] vs discussion [[:forums]]

  * What were the reasons for choosing between blogs and forums as communication and learning tools in the CCK08 course?
  * What factors affect the choice of blogs versus forums as communication and learning tools?

h2. Three dimensions
h3. home <-> bazaar
Dimension of presence, identity, autonomy, home base. 

Progress
  * highly ‘personal thoughts’, ie a set of thoughts-in-progress, to myself
  * to ‘emailed thoughts’ sent to known others
  * to ‘blogged thoughts’ available to known/unknown others
  * to contributing to ‘a forum’s thoughts’ where personal thoughts start to merge into the ‘thoughts of the forum’
  * to contributing to ‘virtual forum’s thoughts’(eg SecondLife)

Preferences for **connecting with people** (blogs) vs **connecting with ideas** (forums)

h3. long-loop <-> short-loop
Pace, crafted responses and type of sequence

  * blogs: carefully thought through, creafted
    * internally coherent set of postings, in sequence, train of thought
  * forums: fast moving, postings and responses are rapid, shorter, more recursive, multi-track, shorter loops

Short loops (generally in forums) provide affordances for people who want to learn predominantly by engagement rather than by reflection, and who find it useful, interesting and stimulating to engage in forums (the bazaars) in which strictly individualised knowledge starts to morph or merge into the knowledge and ideas of the forums (or networks) themselves

**Transferred affordances** (blog posts commented on in forums etc)

h3. engagement <-> reflection
Using tools for communication, versus for own reflection and building up PLE/knowledge base

h2. Learning styles
**Use of blogs** was associated with the ability to create personal space for personal learning, quiet reflection and developing personal relationships with bloggers and others. 

**Use of forums** was associated with fast paced challenging interaction, relationships based on sharing of ideas, more open discussion and more links to the discussed themes and bigger picture

h2. Development
Many transitioned from forums to blogs, because of 
  * unacceptable behaviour (main)
  * lack of moderation
  * unwieldiness
  * expertise divide
