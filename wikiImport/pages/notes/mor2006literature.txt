h4. Goodyear (2004)
[@goodyear2004research]
In an attempt to distance himself from the dominant approaches in e-learning, Goodyear focuses on what he calls networked learning, where technology is used to promote connections between learners and foster communities which make efficient use of their resources. In this context, Goodyear emphasises patterns as a means of empowering practitioners to utilize accumulated design knowledge. His patterns are succinct and written in plain language.

h4. Web-based ed tech
Notable examples in this field include the E-LEN project (http://www2.tisip.no/E-LEN/) and several initiatives within the IMS-LD framework (http://www.imsglobal.org). Most of the work in this area is focused on the engineering aspects of designing, developing, deploying and evaluating good technology for web- based instruction (Frizell & Hubscher, 2002; Hernández-Leo et al, 2006; Bailey et al, 2006)

h4. Pedagogical patterns project
initiated by a group of experienced software engineering and computer science educators (Bergin, 2000; Eckstein, Bergin & Sharp, 2002). They proposed a set of patterns dealing with issues ranging from the design of a college course to specific principles of computer science instruction and to concrete problems and their solutions.

h5. Example: Anthony's “Mix new and old” pattern:

Problem: Basic concepts must be reviewed over and over, but this gets boring for many students. New concepts must be introduced, but few can handle more than 10-15% new material. 

Constraints and Forces: In addition, each student varies in their “learning style”; whether they learn better from doing something, seeing diagrams or demonstrations, or hearing explanations. 

Solution: Iterate over a concept several times. Each time, present the material in a different variation on the learning styles. Each time, mix in some new material with the old. 

This both maintains students' interest through the review and helps them absorb the new material. 

**Related Patterns**: “Simulation Games” provide an alternative to exercises for the learning style that learns by doing. “Visible Checklist” provides an extra stimulus for the group that learns by seeing. “Colorful Analogy” provides a boost for the learn by hearing group.
