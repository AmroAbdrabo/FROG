Comparing open source software and a collaborative animation website ([[http://newgrounds.com|Newgrounds]]) creating **collabs**

h2. Success metrics
h3. Collab

Completing a collab.

<blockquote>Unlike OSS projects and Wikipedia articles, collabs are not constantly improved and re-released many times. Rather, they are typically released to the public just once, much like an independent film debut, and almost never changed again</blockquote>

h4. Importance of success:
  * only completed collabs are available for audiences
  * ratings contribute to karma for each participant
  * may generate income (ad share, cash prizes)

h4. Success factors
  * amount of planning and structure
    * spelling out formats, tech guidelines
  * leader's reputation
  * activity in thread (virtuous circle)

h4. OSS
  * "never truly completed, only abandoned"
  * "successful traditional projects may end with a public release, while many OSS projects begin with a public release, contributed by the leader to attract co-developers"

h5. English and Schweik
English and Schweik [13] produced a six-part classification, based on phone interviews with OSS developers, manual coding of a sample of OSS projects from SourceForge.net, and theoretical insights from Hardin’s “Tragedy of the Commons” [15]. In this system, OSS projects can be successful, abandoned, or indeterminate at two key stages in their life cycle, Initiation and Growth. A successful Initiation stage is defined as OSS developers achieving a first release, and a successful Growth stage is defined as achieving three subsequent releases. English and Schweik operationalized these definitions and tested them on 110,933 SourceForge projects, with low error rates.

h5. Wiggins and Crowston
Wiggins and Crowston [22] validated a refined version with another SourceForge data set, also with good results. Of 117,733 projects, they classified 31% as abandoned at the Initiation stage, 28% as abandoned at the Growth stage, and 14% as successful at both the Initiation and Growth stages. 

Crowston and colleagues [9] developed a set of 18 measures of OSS success, organized into four system process phases: creation and maintenance, quality, use, and consequences. These measures were based on DeLone and McLean’s process model for information systems [11], a literature review of success measures in OSS research, and a survey of OSS developers SlashDot.org. The authors validated their model by operationalizing three of the 18 measures—number of developers, bug-fixing time, and popularity—and testing them on a sample of 120 SourceForge projects. The resulting correlations between measures suggested high convergent validity

**Success Factors**:

  * intrinsic motivation and self-selection for tasks [4,19,21];
  * a charismatic, capable leader [19,20,21];
  * a meritocratic, rational culture [19,21,23];
  * a modular, granular division of labor [4,21]; and
  * use of collaborative technologies, such as CVS, TODO lists,
  * mailing lists [14,23] p 3

h3. Division of labor
OSS and professional film productions have specialized division of labor, whereas collabs are separated by episode (**modularized**), within each episode one person fulfills all roles.
