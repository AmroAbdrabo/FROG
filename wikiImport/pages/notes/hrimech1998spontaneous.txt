h1. Key ideas
//Learning about the use of computers, strategies used by self-learners. Literature review on learning strategies//

h2. Learning strategies
h3. Definitions
  * The study of learning strategies is primarily concerned about how people use their mind to learn something
  * Conscious actions that learners utilize in order to gain direction and control over their learning outcomes
  * The operations utilized by learners for the effective appropriation of knowledge or skills
  * They are deliberate, planned activities that induce or bring about learning
  * Focus is on the learners and their cognitive and metacognitive (i.e. “learning-how-to-learn”) competencies in achieving control over the learning process

h3. Evolution
An individual's preferred strategies evolve over time -> competencies that can be summoned unconsciously whenever the need arises. Then, the strategies have been integrated into the individual's learning style, and to his/her personality. 

h3. Categories
  * cognitive
  * metacognitive
  * affective OR
  * social 
  * mixed

Also
  * direct OR
    * transform, in the mind of the learner, material to be learned into new self-appropriated structures
  * indirect
    * (affective or support strategies)
    * act on learner, to sustain motivation or reduce stress

Can be 
  * general OR
  * specific to a certain 
    * subject matter
    * area
    * task

Either
  * Widely used OR
    * such as repetition
  * idiosyncratic and adapted
    * like imagery or elaboration

Must be **purposefully internalized**, otherwise //mere techniques// or study habits that can be inefficient or counter-productive.

::Does this mean that the student needs a certain level of meta-awareness, able to evaluate whether different methods work for him/her etc?::

h3. Strategies and success
Degree of control learners exercise over own learning through explicit learning strategies have the potential to greatly increase learning effectiveness.

Weak learners often do not use them, because:
  * low cognitive alertness
  * poor learning strategies that nevertheless produce some acceptable results
  * lack of basic knowledge
  * external attributional style
  * lack of or insufficient transfer of learning
(Gamer, 1990)

h3. Cognitive psychology
This research builds on the cognitive paradigm. Cognitive psychology considers human beings as deliberate agents who actively process information throughout their lifetime. 

The study of learning strategies has been strongly influenced by the cognitivist perspective, which is also aligned with the philosophical assumptions underlying the study of self-directed learning (Long, 1992). 

h3. Importance of studying learning strategies
Some authors in SDL have stressed the importance of studying the strategies SDL learners use, an area which is still hardly known (Olgren, 1992). 

In her unifying framework for data-based research into adult self-directed learning, Danis (1992) makes the study of self-regulated learning strategies the core of his framework, pointing out the importance of relating the strategies to the learning content and the learning context. 

h2. Study design

Qualitative design that included a semistructured interview schedule. 

h3. Demographics
Twenty volunteers, twelve females and eight males, aged between 25 years and 48 years, were interviewed. 

h3. Questions

  * what methods they used when faced with new computer-related tasks
  * how they went about figuring out how to get them done
  * detail the strategies that they used when they encountered learning difficulties
  * estimate those strategies' effectiveness
  * strategies that were tried out and subsequently abandoned
  * about the reasons for their perceived lack of effectiveness

h2. Findings
Affective or supportive strategies:

  * Positive self-talk
  * Play
    * having fun, leaving task and exploring other aspects
  * Perseverance
    * not really a category, but many cited this
