h1. Key ideas

h2. “The Learning Model”: How would we detect learning in this space?
  * A naıve idea: model learning as vocabulary acquisition
    * perhaps with “certification” through the evaluation process
  * More complete: model learning as a change in patterns of behavior
  * Sophisticated: model learning in terms of the use of new heuristic strategies

h2. Behavior change
Here we would look for behavior like:
  * Working at the cutting edge (introducing new material?)
  * Progressive problem solving (working at increasing depth?)
  * Collaborative effort (asking or answering questions?)
  * User-Identified high points (bookmarked threads and articles?)
  * Processing level (eg browsing vs attempting to solve problems?) 
  * Quality of self-explanation (knowing how activities relate to goals?)  
  * Exploration (trying different resources?)
