h1. Key ideas

//A collection of short reports from a workshop in 2011 on the future of publishing//

h2. Things to check out
  * The Open Citations Corpus (http://opencitations.net/) contains references to 3.4 million biomedical papers, representing 20% of all PubMed Central papers published between 1950 and 2010, and including all the highly cited papers in every biomedical field.
  * SciVerse from Elsevier
  * “Executable journals”
    * It will help us do science-on-demand (“press this button to re-run your thesis”), and equally the papers can process new data autonomously, generating new results which in turn get processed by other papers.
    * You’ll receive an email notification when the paper you wrote five years ago is re-run with new inputs from other people’s papers, and so will the people who used yours.
