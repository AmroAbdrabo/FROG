//Literature review of measuring attitudes of young children towards children with disabilities, read for survey design course//

Article discusses ways of measuring how typically developing children react/feel about children with disabilities, especially young children.  Theoretical framework is Triandis:

  * cognitive (how much do you know about disabilities)
  * emotional (how do you feel about kids with disabilities)
  * behavioural (what do you do - what actions/roles do you perform)

There were a number of different research approaches
  * surveys (using many existing scales and measures)
  * using dolls or drawings/photos and hypotheticals
  * sorting pictures of classmates (after first practicing sorting foods etc) according to preference
  * interview
  * prompting with videos (Sesame Street etc)
  * observation of play activity

Few statistical relationships were discussed, mainly between self-reported attitudes and actual playground behaviour (different studies are contradictory).
