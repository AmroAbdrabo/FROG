h1. Key ideas

//This paper was discussed in Clare Brett's research group Feb 14, 2011//

The paper criticizes facile use of neuroscience to inform teaching strategies, highlighting three fallacies:

  * Critical periods
    * yes, some things are learnt more easily when kids are young, but other things are better learnt when they are older, such as critical thinking
    * it is possible to learn to read etc in adulthood as well
  * Brain-based education
    * "growing dendrites" - but is number of dendrites the right measure of learning?
    * number of connections between synapses better measurement - seems to be strenghtened by memorization, rather than constructivist approaches
    * both halves are used at the same time, impossible to target one half
  * Learning styles
    * is it always good to teach to kids strengths? kids need to challenge their weaknesses
