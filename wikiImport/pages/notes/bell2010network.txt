h1. Key ideas
//Participated in CCK08, examines the intersection between connectivism and actor-network theory. No empirical data presented.//

h2. Knowledge
Siemens (2006) recommends that a practical discussion of knowledge can be held if it is seen as: **something that a) describes some aspect of the world, and b) something on which we can act** (Siemens, 2006, p. 150) 

h2. Research design

h3. Research Questions
  * How does Connectivism behave as a knowledge network (in the CCK08 course and beyond)?
  * Can Actor Network Theory (and Social Shaping Theories in general) inform the development of Connectivism as a knowledge network? 

h3. Methods
Participation in CCK08, searches in Moodle forum and blogs, Google Scholar/Google searches

h2. Connectivism
h3. Principles
  * Learning and knowledge rests in diversity of opinions
  * Learning is a process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources
  * Learning may reside in non-human appliances
  * Capacity to know more is more critical than what is currently known
  * Nurturing and maintaining connections is needed to facilitate continual learning
  * Ability to see connections between fields, ideas concepts is a core skill
  * Currency (accurate, up-to-date knowledge) is the intent of all connectivist learning activities
  * Decision-making is itself a learning process Choosing what to learn and the meaning of incoming information is seen through the lens of a shifting reality While there is a right answer now, it may be wrong tomorrow due to alterations in the information climate affecting the decision

Principles of Connectivism (Siemens, 2004)

h3. Limitations of other theories
Limitations of behaviourism, cognitivism and constructivism: their intrapersonal view of learning; their failure to address the learning that is located within technology and organizations; and their lack of contribution to the value judgments that need to be made in knowledge-rich environments (Siemens, 2004)

h3. Groups and networks
In 2006 Downes outlined a controversial distinction between groups and networks in a [[http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2006/10/that-group-feeling.html|moving blog post]], and presented this in a more formal way in [[http://www.downes.ca/post/42521|this presentation]] in New Zealand. **Downes characterises networks, in comparison with groups as emphasising diversity, autonomy, openness and emergent knowledge.** (This has been controversial). 

h2. Actor-Network Theory
Activity Theory has been developed over three ‘generations’ and is now widely used in the interpretation of the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in education and other domains. Its inclusion of cultural artifacts is an asset in the analysis of the development and use of technology, viewing human activity as being mediated by artifacts over time. Humans engage in this mediated activity in networks, which can themselves be reconfigured through expansive transformation. However the primary focus remains on human activity, whereas Actor Network Theory (ANT) includes human and non-human material objects in its symmetric analysis, that is also reflected in Connectivism’s assertion that learning resides in non-human appliances.

Under the general umbrella of Social Shaping Theories (SST), various theories have emerged, including Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) (Mackenzie & Wacjman, 1999), and Actor-Network Theory (J. Law & Hassard, 1999). These theories emerged from Science and Technology Studies as a response to the then prevailing view, technological determinism, characterised as the belief that Technologies change, either because of scientific advance or following a logic of their own; and then they have effects on society. (Mackenzie & Wacjman, 1999) Fox (2005) identifies three key aspects of Actor Network Theory: symmetrical analysis whereby material and non-human elements are treated the same as social and human elements; ANT analyses are intended to illuminate how a network grows and decays rather than explain outcomes; and third that the process of growth/decay is one of translation (Fox, 2005). Law (2007) tells us that ANT is not a theory but rather it is descriptive, telling us stories of how things do or do not assemble, a sociology of translation, emphasizing the work of human and non-human actors in building a network, as they form alliances. 

Need for "rich empirical stories of networks and alliances building and fragmenting", which you have with ANT, but not yet with Connectivism.

"What does it mean for a network to know" vs "How did the network come to be at a moment in time"

h2. Findings
h3. Connectivism as knowledge network
Network of people, published papers, blog posts, events. 

h3. Nurturing and maintaining connections
Tension between extending network and nurturing connections -  the legitimate practice of filtering to manage information overload can militate against finding new connections, and the nurturing of fragile connections. Many people drop out - not able to maintain connections?

h3. Currency
Sources used (OA materials) and means of dissemination (blogs and web links) are focused on the open web. Tends to exclude a lot of traditional scholarly publishing.


h2. Look into
  * Gagne's nine events of instruction
  * Networked theories of learning (Goodyear, 2001)
  * Snowden's 4 ontologies of knowledge
  * rhizomatic knowledge (Cormier, 2008)
