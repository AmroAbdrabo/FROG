h1. Key ideas

h2. Post-it notes
**Pros**
  * representationally neutral
  * capture diagrams and drawings, as well as text
  * different sizes affords different kinds of activities
  * informal - better suited to quick sketches than highly finished ideas
  * meta-informatic (can annotate other representations, including other post-its)
  * rearrangable, position and reposition to convey meaning
  * unique - can only be one place at one time
  * shareable - many can interact with it

**Cons**
  * size is static - can't zoom in, view from distance
  * unique - can't have in two different places
  * doesn't scale - too many people, etc
  * hard to archive/publish result of post-it activity

h2. Rapid collaborative knowledge building techniques
  * problem identification
  * brainstorming
  * prioritizing
  * concept mapping
  * action planning

h2. Tool design
In choosing tools to support individual and collective intelligence, two choices:
  * provide support for explicit group processes ([[:representational guidance]])
  * OR light-weight tools that support multi-faceted interactions with emergent conventions
(ref [@dwyer2005study] and [@brignull2004collaboration])

h4. Backstory
Suppose a furniture company wants to brainstorm ways to improve its chair design. The question “how can we make a better chair?” is posed before the group. 

h4. Process
  * Each participant captures several ideas as words or sketches in their private space and then drags the few that are most appropriate onto the public space 
  * Alice notices some common themes (e.g. materials), so she clusters related items
  * Bob uses a different (tan) color note to pose a question
  * Cathy notices Bob’s question, drags it into her private space (thereby ensuring that no-one else is working on it), composes the “answer” note, attaches it to Bob’s question using a virtual paperclip, and moves the result back into the public space
  * Derek compliments Ella’s idea by attaching a green sticker (sticker conventions were agreed-on beforehand); this idea already has a few green stickers, making it likely to be chosen as the final solution
  * Frank notices the cluster of ideas related to materials and incites a discussion sub-group on that topic, by creating a new shared space and inviting some participants to brainstorm within the space
  * George, who was absent during the session, logs in later and adds a few ideas of his own (perhaps triggering an automatic notification to other participants)
