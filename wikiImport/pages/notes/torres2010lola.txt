h1. Notes

h2. Online Learning Laboratory
a collaborative learning methodology for classroom-based and distance-learning (LOLA).

Activities aim at encouraging knowledge construction. This chapter describes case study with students in postgrad course in education.

h2. Cooperative vs collaborative learning
differ in terms of
  * role, authority and degree of intervention of the teacher
  * hierarcalization of teaching-learning process
  * construction and assimilation of knowledge
  * way in which groups are organized
  * individual and group responsibility for the activities (Matthews, Cooper & Hawkes, 2004)

h3. 7 activities
  * discussing texts chosen by teacher
    * use chat or forum to prepare comment on chosen reading
    * comments are published, can be discussed by teams
    * "management of heterogeneity"
  * inserting links and proposing connections with systematized knowledge
    * bibliographic research, "state of the art" related to subject
    * make this available to other students
    * published using EUREKA
  * questioning existing knowledge
    * individually (QuestInd) and in small groups (QuestGru) students prepare questions about texts read
    * teacher: provides guidance, push students to develop more complex questions
    * in forum tool
  * replying to questions that have been drawn up
    * individually (RespInd) or groups (RespGru)
    * establish their own criteria for choosing question, and content and length of answer
  * preparing concept maps
    * "preparing a collective text"
    * map is synthesis of texts teams have worked on
  * producing new knowledge
    * dialogue between group members to choose subject for article
    * each member writes own contributions
    * forward to other members, complete and refute or add ideas
    * added to portfolios
  * evaluating procedures that were used
