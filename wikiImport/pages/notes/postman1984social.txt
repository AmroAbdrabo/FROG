h1. Key ideas

//Basically a whole-sale refutation of social science as a "science", positing social scientists as tellers of narrative, and moral tales - compared to great authors//

most students don't have ideology - more practical
some are marxists, proclaim it. very useful - helps debate

what are legitimate forms of research in soc sci?
what are social purposes of such research?

reject social "science"

processes vs practices (Oakeshott)
irrevocable difference between a blink and a wink :)

misconception 
"anyone who counts things is involved in science"

why science? prestige

NO, it's telling anecdotes about human behaviour - story telling
narrative vs exposition - genre (Kinsey) / documentary
archetypes and metaphores

we are among our culture's most important tellers of psychological and social tales
purpose; didactic and moralistic, not to "improve the field"
all social sciences are subdivisions of moral theology
