h2. Development and Validation of a Scale to Place Students along a Learning Progression
//Namsoo Shin, Shawn Y. Stevens//

Learning progression

ConQuest software (Wu, Adams, Wilson and Haldane, 2007)


h2. The Knowledge connections Analyzer
//Jan van Aalst, Carol Chan, Stella Tian, Christopher Teplovs, Yuan Chan, Wing‚ÄêSan Wan//

h3. Goals
  * transformative and embedded assessment essential to knowledge building
  * previous studies: students can develop e-portfolios of KB and this works help them understand how to interact online
  * but portfolio assessments not embedded, labor intensive and difficult. Need tools and strategies for making it more feasible

The analysis of the database shouldn't only be the responsibility of the researcher or the teacher, but of the students themselves

h3. Tool
  * converts KF database to MySql database
  * Queries to answer 4 basic questions students may have about their work in KF
    * designed to help students reflect on the KB principles
      * are we a community (class) that collaborates?
      * are we putting our knowledge together?
      * how do our ideas develop over time?
      * what's happening to my own ideas?
  * [[http://kbc2.edu.hku.hk|Tools will be available here]]

Different ways of analyzing and visualizing who/how many are building on your notes, or linking to your notes.

h2. Bidirectional artifact analysis: A method for analyzing creative processes
//Alecia Marie Magnifico, Erica Rosenfeld Halverson//

h3. Steps
  * Identify a learner-created digital artefact (start with final product)
  * Document relevant data around the artefact
    * tracing each step in the process of creation
    * identifying all of the draft artifacts
    * creating a timeline of all exogenous research data related to the production
    * (form and presentation of artifact may change substantially over the course of drafts and critiques)
  * Construct narrative threads across the data types that trace the core ideas and tools present in the final product back through their development
