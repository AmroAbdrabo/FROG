h1. Productive Failure
//Keynote by [[:a:Manu Kapur]]//

h2. The case for failure
  * Cognitive strain and disfluency (fonts harder to read, higher cognitive load, paying more attention, less likely to be tricked up by problems etc)
  * Theory of constructive failure (Clifford, 1978, 1984)
  * Desirable difficulties (Schmidt & Bjork, 1992)
  * Impasse-driven learning (VanLehn et al, 2003) (explanation shouldn't come before a learner is stuck)
  * Assistance dilemma (Koedinger et al, 2008) (cognitive tutors)
  * Preparation for future learning; Inventing to prepare for learning (Schwartz & Bransford, 1999; Schwartz & Martin, 2004) (classroom-based research)

h2. What is productive failure

Understand what students know about a novel concept that they have not been taught.

Opportunities to activate and differentiate prior and intuitive knowledge
  * generate
  * explore
  * critique
  * refine
representations and solution methods (RSMs) for solving complex problems.

This leads to failure, but may be locus of deep learning, provided soe form of structure follow subsequently. 

h2. Designing for produtive failure
//Kapur & Bielaczyc, 2012//
  * generation & exploration
    * complex problems
    * collaboration
    * affective support for persistence
  * consolidation & knowledge assembly
    * consolidation
      * well-structured problem solving
      * instruction
      * feedback
      * explanation
      * etc

**Delay of structure** (not **if** you should provide structure, but **when**)

h2. Core mechanisms
  * activation and differentiation of prior knowledge
  * attention to critical conceptual features
  * ownership - want to see the canonical solution
  * becoming flexible and adaptive
  * "feel like mathematicians"

h2. Key findings
  * Marginal gains of providing cognitive support for productive failure groups during generation phase was not significant
  * Teachers consistently underestimate students' ability to generate RSMs
  * Students strikingly dissimilar on general and math abilities strikingly similar in terms of generative capacity
  * How much they produce significantly correlated with learning gains
  * Teachers - stressed and stretched to work with students' ideas - but they themselves understood the math better

h2. Vicarious failure?
  * We can learn from our own failures, can we learn from other people's failure? Vicarious failure
  * Empirically, you get effect from direct teaching, but even more from having students generate their own failures

h2. Cognitive load theory
  * controlled experiments almost uniformly indicate that when dealing with **novel** information, learners should be explicitly shown what to do and how to do it (Kirschner et al 2006)
  * **Cognitive Load**: un-guided or minimally-guided instruction increases working memory load that interferes with schema formation
  * Compared some version of worked example or strong instructional guidance condition with a pure problem-solving or discovery conditions. Conclusion: little efficacy in letting learners solve novel problems

Better to compare this with letting students **first** solve novel problems on their own, **then** some form of structure.

h3. Solution found in cognitive-load theory itself
"Any instructional theory that ignores the limits of working memory when dealing with novel information or **ignores the disappearance of those limits when dealing with familiar information** is unlikely to be effective" (Krischner et al, 2006, p 77).

The key is **what is novel information**.

h3. Novelty defined
  * canonical: students don't have the canonical formulation in long-term memory (LTM), therefore concept is novel
  * non-canconical: students may not have the canonical formulation, but may have some prior or intuitive ways of thinking about the concept in LTM

If so, could we not design tasks and activity structures to activate this knowledge in the LTM?

By activating and working with these priors in the long-term memory, leverage the "expandable" aspects of working memory capacity?

h2. Conclusion
Productive success and productive failure are all good - but we don't want unproductive success. And certainly not unproductive failure!
