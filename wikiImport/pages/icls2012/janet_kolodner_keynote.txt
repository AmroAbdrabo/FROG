Learning deeply, //a process of mental model building//, takes sustained and long-term effort and often requires a lot of help.

(the Italic text is partly controversial)

h2. What we know

  * Promoting and sustaining active engagement is somewhere between 50% and 80% of promoting learning
  * Learning is a process of iteratively constructing, revising and connecting together mental models - models of what we know and models of how to do things
  * Becoming fluid at reasoning skills is an iterative process of composing and debugging sequences of how-to's (Schank and Abelson; Anderson; Newell, Rosenbloom Laird)
  * We know we need to learn something when a mental model or how-to sequence doesn't do the work we want it to do - either we can't do something we want to or or something turns out different than we expected or something happens that we weren't expecting and can't explain
  * Great deal of reflection and inteerpretation needed to recognize the need to learn and to troubleshoot and revise ones mental models

h3. Helping learners build mental models
  * framing first, details later (Collins)
  * help learners experience the results of their decisions, help learners interpret those results and use them to debug their reasoning and understanding; repeat over and over again, repeated deliberative practice
  * includes reflection on, articulation of debugging of reasoning (interperstation)
  * recurring opportunities to try out, troubleshoot and revise understanding
  * lead students to wonder by asking questions (book, teacher and peers can play this role)
  * allow learners to notice, to identify what they do and don't understand
  * promote identifying holes in one's mental models and generating questions
  * help learners care enough (so they have learning goals) to put in the mental energy to construct and revise mental models
  * help learners connect their mental models by helping them recognize and revisit what they already know and the implications of that on what they are learning (knowledge integration, Linn)

h3. Intrinsic motivation promotes sustained active engagement

  * Personal and epistemological connections promote engagement and learning (Papert, Resnick)
    * connect with prior knowledge 
    * when they are interested
    * when what they are learning connects to the real world and they are helped make that connection
    * with a goal in mind, learners will themselves become curious and want to learn 
  * Communities of practice work together to help each other achieve goals
    * community (of many kinds) encourages engagement
    * can be created in formal and informal learning environments, with engineered early activities to promote shared values and ways of doing, continued work together to sustain the community (Kolodner)
    * community engagement gives learners opportunities to imagine what they might be, and mentors can help learners align themselves to their imaginations
  * Thick authenticity for maintaining integrity (Shaffer and Resnick)
    * keep it real to keep people engaged - thickly athentic in the mind of the learners
    * personal, disciplinary, real world, assessment authenticity
    * solving problems relevant to the world learners live in, having available the same kinds of tools and resources professionals would have
    * a big question or challenge promotes personal connection (Krajcik, Edelson, Reiser, Kolodner)
    * assessment is embedded, relevant to learners' goals, and meaningful to learners
  * Turning over agency to learners allow learners to decide for themselves to participate (Holland)
    * encouraging agency encourages engagement, and disposition
  * Providing scaffolding that promotes success and self-assessment keeps it challenging but not out of reach

h2. Implications
  * lessons will be de-emphasized
  * challenges will be emphasized
    * not the same as projects
    * projects are about doing something, challenges about achieving something
  * activities will be in the context of challenges, and lessons in the context of activities
  * lectures will be for purposes identified by learners, and they will often be short and impromptu, recorded and available as needed, or interactive (to be watched as a group, stopped and started as needed, watched and then discussed)
  * reading, like lectures, will be for purposes identifed by learners to answer questions they have raised or to provide details on what they have already experienced or contextualized

h3. Classrooms
  * places for addressing challenges together
  * learning will be purposeful
  * assessment will be purposeful
