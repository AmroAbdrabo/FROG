h1. Programming projects

//Some quick notes, brainstorming on learning new programming languages, programming projects etc//

Currently I know Ruby, which I've used for the last few years. 

h3. Ruby
  * very difficult to make Mac GUI apps
    * the GUI part
    * the installation/distribution part
    * (might be partially solved by RubyMotion, but non-OSS, and 90% of focus on iOS. Few example apps etc. Don't know how compatible all existing libraries are. Some good work on wrapping libraries to abstract Objective C libraries)
  * very little support for data science, machine learning, statistics
  * community very focused on web development, not academic computing etc.  

h3. Clojure
  * very interesting paradigm, and history  
  * lot's of very intelligent people involved
  * many companies contributing libraries
  * leverage Java libraries
  * ClojureScript for the web
  * but slow JVM startup, stack traces
  * easier to distribute? easier to make GUIs? but still not native. few example apps. 
  * lack of good citeproc/bibtex libraries in Clojure/Java

h2. What kinds of things do I want to build/be able to build?

h3. Continuing work on Researchr... 
  * Rewriting as an app in Clojure? Tons of work, missing libraries... 
  * Could remove dependency on Keyboard Maestro (capture keyboard shortcuts) and make it easier to distribute
  * Possibly integrate wiki (but hard to replicate all of Dokuwiki functionality)
  * Still dependent on BibDesk and Skim
  * Possibility of rewriting parts of it as web-only, using Clojure/ClojureScript? Is there a minimal set of functionality that would be useful?

h3. Time tracker/quantified self
  * Server/client with API
  * Define some kind of data format (events, time periods, etc)
  * Visualization - in GUI with JFreeCharts, or in browser with D3/C2 etc?
  * Leverage any of the work on LightTable, getting ClojureScript to work in GUI?

h3. Data wrangling/stats/machine learning
  * R for now
  * Julia
  * Clojure with Incanter - might not be worth it for now
