Formally defined in the literature by Lage, Platt and Treglia (2000) as the “Inverted Classroom”, the catalyst for initial research was a need, particularly at the university level, to address a detrimental mismatch observed between instructor pedagogy and student learning style (p. 32). By inverting events that took place inside and outside of their economics classrooms, instructors in the study were afforded more time to address the myriad of student learning styles present in class, while reserving traditional lecture for students to view outside of class (Borge & Shapiro, 1996).
