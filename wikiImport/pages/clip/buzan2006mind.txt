h1. The Mind Map Book

Notes:

  * radiant thinking
  * every time you have a thought, biochemical/magnetic resistance along the pathway carrying that thought is reduced, like trying to clear a path through a forest. the more times a 'mental event' happens, the more likely it is to happen again.

**Psychology of learning**
during the learning process, the human brain primarily remembers the following:
  * items from beginning of learning period (primacy effect)
  * items from end of learning period (recency effect)
  * any items //associated// with things or patterns already stored, or linked to other aspects of what is being learned
  * any items **emphasized** as being outstanding or unique
  * any items that appeal particularly strongly to one of the five senses
  * those items of particular interest to the person

Key part: association and emphasis. Lacking in linear lecture notes. (BUT: difference between constructing a mind map for your own use, and using a mind map to convey information to others who did not participate in creating it). 

  * brains tend to look for pattern and completion
  * mind map allows an infinite sequence of associative 'probes' which comprehensively investigate any idea or question with which you are concerned
    * !! sounds like [[a:Dan Suthers]] representational guidance, boxes that //want// to be filled in
  * brain has five functions
    * receiving
    * holding
    * analysing
    * outputting
    * controlling
  * Lorraine Gill's paper "Line is manmade"
  * once mankind realized they could externalize their internal 'mental pictures', development was rapid
  * distinction between 
  * note-taking - summarizing someone else's thoughts, book, lecture etc
  * note-making - making sense of your own thoughts

  * disadvantages of standard notes
    * obscure the key words
      * key words spread over different pages
      * hidden in torrent of words
    * make it difficult to remember
      * one color, looks the same, boring
    * waste time
      * write/read/find/try to remember unnecessary notes
    * fail to stimulate the brain creatively
      * linear nature prevents brain from making associations
      * list-style makes the brain thinks it's gotten to the end
  * consequence of disadvantages
    * lose power of concentration
    * make notes on notes, to discover elusive essence of what we are studying
    * Sherevsky (Russian) w/perfect memory used this method to //forget//

Research by Dr Howe (Exeter University) on note-making/taking

**Mind map**
  * always radiates from a central image - subject of attention crystallized in a central image
  * every word and image becomes itself a subcentre of association
  * branches comprise a key image or key word printed on associated line
  * topics of lesser importance are also represented as branches attached to higher-level branches
  * branches form a connected nodal structure
  * help you make distinction between mental storage capacity (which mind maps help you demonstrate) and mental storage efficiency (which mind maps help you achieve)

**Mini mind map**
  * associations to a given word are very personal and distinct (in large group very rare that associations are the same)
  *
