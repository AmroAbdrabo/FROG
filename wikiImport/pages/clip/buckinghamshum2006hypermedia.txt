Abstract: Having developed, used and evaluated some of the early IBIS-based approaches to design rationale (DR) such as gIBIS and QOC in the late 1980s/mid-1990s, we describe the subsequent evolution of the argumentation-based paradigm through software support, and per- spectives drawn from modeling and meeting facilitation. Particular attention is given to the challenge of negotiating the overheads of capturing this form of rationale. Our approach has maintained a strong emphasis on keeping the representational scheme as simple as possible to enable real time meeting mediation and capture, attending explicitly to the skills required to use the approach well, particularly for the sort of participatory, multi-stakeholder requirements analysis demanded by many design problems. However, we can then specialize the notation and the way in which the tool is used in the service of specific methodologies, supported by a cus- tomizable hypermedia environment, and interoperable with other software tools. After present- ing this approach, called Compendium, we present examples to illustrate the capabilities for support security argumentation in requirements engineering, template driven modeling for document generation, and IBIS-based indexing of and navigation around video records of meet- ings.

Since the late 1980s, through business and industrial case studies, detailed lab analysis, and continual design refinement, we have been reflecting on the set of interacting factors which together can ‘make or break’ them in the heat of collaborative analysis, modeling and design. The Compendium technique and tool has matured to the point where a steering group (a subset of the authors) is coordinating the development of an open source Java hypermedia IBIS mapping tool, with an international user community spanning government, NGOs, education and business, docu- mented case studies, and training courses and online resources.

The capture problem is the spectre haunting all design rationale efforts (indeed, all knowledge management efforts attempting to meaningfully capture elements of human reasoning and dis- course). How does one acquire quality input to a rationale management system, without disrupt- ing the very process it is designed to support, or without having to employ dedicated scribes who do nothing but maintain rationale libraries? [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#3|p. 3]]

The cost-benefit tradeoff is a slippery tightrope to walk, and has focused our energies on a “value now, value later” imperative. As Grudin [13] has pointed out, there cannot be a disparity between who invests effort in a groupware system, and who benefits. No designer can be ex- pected to altruistically enter quality design rationale solely for the possible benefit of a possibly unknown person at an unknown point in the future for an unknown task. There must be immedi- ate value. The difficulty, of course, is that it is not merely a “capture” problem, but “useful cap- ture”. One could minimize the capture effort and simply video record every design meeting, but this would not render a useful archive. Computationally tractable structure must be added by some means. Extracting useful content automatically from multimedia meeting records is an active research area, but very challenging. Later we will report on the synergy of combining the richness of video-based DR with argumentation-oriented approaches, but let us first focus on the specific capture problem associated with the latter. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#3|p. 3]]

Very soon after “idea processing” visual hypertext systems such as NoteCards [14] and gIBIS [9] began to be used for structuring ideas, reports began to emerge of “cognitive overhead”. A [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#3|p. 3]]

1994 survey [3] found comparatively weak evidence regarding usability and utility compared to what might have been expected given the scale of system development efforts. A later survey echoed this, highlighting the pattern of failure in many kinds of interactive systems that assume the willingness of users to structure information [29] [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#4|p. 4]]

Nonetheless, encouraged by the limited success of the gIBIS prototype in an industrial case study [11] that the above problems were surmountable, the early 1990s saw the launch by Conk- lin and colleagues of a commercial software tool that combined graphical hypertext, IBIS and groupware capabilities. The QuestMap Windows single user and groupware product made a mark in the hypertext and groupware communities, and even resulted in a few isolated cases of extended industrial-strength use [8]. However, this product ultimately succumbed to market pressures, and is no longer available. Much was learnt from this episode, in particular an appre- ciation of the value that can be added in design meetings once people have learnt the meta- cognitive skills of using IBIS, some of whom may then appreciate quality software support to overcome the limits of mapping on paper, whiteboards, or a generic drawing tool. Let us con- sider the nature of this skill in more detail. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#4|p. 4]]

::Interesting to think about difference between beginners and experts, how do you capture this in laboratories? Can only be captured through prolonged use.:: [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#4|p. 4]]

We have studied the issue of “intrusiveness” (see Chapter 1) in depth via detailed, video-based analyses. Moreover, we are interested in characterizing not just the initial learning curve (which is what most people have focused on) but also the nature of highly skilled practice. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#4|p. 4]]

One study of beginners focused on software designers learning to use QOC (on paper), and provided a detailed account of how designers ::::must learn to manage four interleaving cognitive tasks [2]: unbundling (identifying and separating constituent elements of ideas which have been ‘bundled together’ when they were initially expressed, but which from an argumentation per- spective need to be teased apart), classification (deciding whether a contribution is a Question, Option or Criterion), naming (labelling the new contribution succinctly but meaningfully), and structuring (linking in a new element to other ideas)::::. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#4|p. 4]]

Buckingham Shum et al [4] argued that “On reflection, reports of cogni- tive overhead should not be surprising. The basis on which [concept mapping tools] work is that deeper understanding of a domain comes through the discipline of expressing knowledge within a structural framework, working to articulate important distinctions and relationships.” [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#4|p. 4]]

At this point, however, although Buckingham Shum had a lab-based account of when QOC seemed useful or obstructive, he had a poorly developed conception of how to turn that effort to the group’s advantage. This was a ‘missing piece of the jigsaw’ that some of the other authors of this chapter provided: Conklin from a facilitation perspective developed during the Quest- Map/IBIS consulting period, and later, Selvin and Sierhuis from a collaborative modeling per- spective [24]. The next section describes how these insights combine in our current understand- ing. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#4|p. 4]]

Beyond the initial learning curve for novices, we have recently begun to characterize the learning curve as one gains proficiency. What does it mean to become an expert in mapping IBIS structures to support problem solving and design cognition? Selvin [25] has characterized the kinds of skills that such a practitioner needs to possess, and more recently has begun to ar- ticulate, based on video analysis of Compendium in use in web-mediated meetings, the kinds of ‘moves’ that a mapper can make to assist the team in the problem solving, and the associated skills [26]. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#4|p. 4]]

To summarise, DR that yields insight into the complex ideas and arguments that may lie be- hind a decision does not come “for free”: effort must be invested at some point in the rationale management lifecycle. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#4|p. 4]]

Compendium represents our current effort to take the raw conception of IBIS, and deliver it in a form where it can smoothly integrate in the ‘matrix’ of everyday tools and practices. Our tech- nical objective is to provide a robust, open environment in the IBIS/argumentation-based DR paradigm, which can then be integrated with other DR paradigms and tools, such that services can be implemented over the extended-IBIS representational substrate. Our approach to the capture problem is to invest rationale structuring effort primarily at the point of capture, validating it with the key stakeholders, which in the process serves their needs to understand each other, know that their viewpoint has been heard, and co-evolve a shared pic- ture of the problem, possible ways forward, and the rationale for deciding which. This is sup- ported by a software tool which can further lower the data entry overhead: data already entered in other key tools can be imported, and data entered in the rationale tool can automatically populate other tools, or generate documentation. There are three dimensions to understanding Compendium: ::::(1) its functionality as a hyper- media concept mapping environment, (2) how it uses IBIS to support collaborative modeling of a problem using any conceptual framework, and (3) in the context of mapping ideas in real time during a meeting, the role of the person doing the mapping to facilitate the task at hand::::. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#5|p. 5]]

Compendium comes ‘pre-loaded’ with node and link types for IBIS, derived from QuestMap’s interpretation of the notation, for connecting key issues, possible responses to these, and rele- vant arguments. Figure 5.1 shows the default node types, which include additional nodes be- yond IBIS for Lists and Maps (containers for nodes), Decisions, Notes, and References that can hyperlink to open a web page or other document. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#5|p. 5]]

::By using lot's of keyboard shortcuts, overhead of having to choose different kinds of notes etc can be alleviated. Still requires training, both to quickly identify what kind of contribution something is, and to use the tool effectively "in the head of it":: [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#5|p. 5]]

Figure 5.2 shows a design rationale extract from a project meeting, in which an issue is raised, two options explored, and one justified. Figure 5.3 shows the use of Compendium sim- ply to record decisions (about metadata). While these might simply have been recorded in a word processor or slide tool, such tools do not support (i) the possibility of capturing important discussion/rationale if it arises, or (ii) the reuse of a decision in subsequent other contexts – see the links on the bottom node to its other appearnaces in the database. ::::Users can also define their own custom modeling language, by building their own palettes of icons (called Stencils) and relational types (Linksets). This is not currently a full meta-modeling tool, however, in that con- straints cannot be specified between nodes and links: any two nodes can be linked using any linktype.:::: [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#6|p. 6]]

Compendium maps are not ‘flat’ drawings, but views onto a relational database that can be rendered in multiple formats. A given node (e.g. representing an idea, argument, entity, or document) can appear and be updated in multiple views. Since any application document or URL can be dragged and dropped into a map as a Reference node, so an external document can be linked into one or more discussions and tracked – that is, given one or more meaningful con- texts where it plays a role. Corrections or updates to a node are immediately updated in every context in which it appears. This provides precisely the representational capability needed to build semi-structured models in which a particular object is systematically reused (e.g. an idea, plan, person, system, location). [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#7|p. 7]]

An Applications Programming Interface (API) enables other sys- tems to read and write to the database directly, so concept maps can be generated from another data source or interpreted for processing by another system. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#7|p. 7]]

A shared database can be maintained either by using a MySQL server, or in experimental versions, through mirroring databases syn- chronously between two clients over the internet, using the Jabber XML messaging protocol (which also enables Compendium to send and receive nodes from Jabber instant messaging cli- ents on any device3). The most common means of sharing data is via XML. All maps can be published to the Web as interactive image maps or linearised as HTML outline documents. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#7|p. 7]]

In Compendium, a modeling approach is translated into an issue template, which can also be created simply to deal with any well understood situation where there is a recommended approach to proceed, for instance, from best practice or a standard operating pro- cedure. Figure 5.4 shows a template for modeling a business process, prior to its instantiation. Templates were created to support structured modeling within the IBIS framework, which by definition moves the tool into the space of reasonably well-structured problems. These are much easier contexts in which a beginner can use Compendium, since they are provided with a repre- sentational scaffold for working through a set of predefined issues. Assuming the meeting has faith in the template, when its questions have been answered, the meeting can be confident that they have made some progress. A hallmark of the approach is, however, the ability to break from formal and prescribed representations into informal, ad hoc communication, incorporating both in the same view if that is helpful to the participants (e.g. “in this context we should really ask a different question...”). Hypertext nodes and links can thus be added either in accordance with templates or in an opportunistic fashion. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#7|p. 7]]

A complement to issue templates are tags (metadata keywords) assigned to any concept (node) in the database to show connections through membership in a common category. Tags serve to specialize a node type with as many attributes as required for it to play multiple roles in different contexts. At the end of the session all of the nodes so marked can be harvested. In modeling, nodes sharing a tag are often tracked as a ‘catalogue’ of nodes stored for future reuse. Tags may reflect generic meeting processes (e.g. Action-Jane), or may be driven by an underly- ing methodology that Compendium is being used to support (e.g. Data-Provider). Alternatively, ad hoc tags can be created on the fly, to reflect the emergence of a new theme. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#8|p. 8]]

As reviewed in Chapter 1, it has long been recognized that DR cannot exist in a vacuum but must be connected to relevant design artifacts and views. This can be done by dropping an ap- plication document or Web URL into Compendium to create a hyperlinked Reference node, but tags provide a mechanism for deeper level connections. Since nodes may originate from other systems (written directly via the MySQL API or manually imported as XML) it is possible to use tags to mirror attributes of the domains which these external systems model. The world of IBIS is thus connected via the simple mechanisms of templates, tags and hyperlinks to any other relevant domain, from end-user scenarios and organizational processes, to software architecture and project management. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#8|p. 8]]

Turning to the third element of the approach, facilitation, ::::Dialogue Mapping4:::: is a set of skills for mapping ideas as IBIS structures in order to support the analysis of wicked problems, as de- [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#8|p. 8]]

For an introductory account of how Dialogue Mapping is used during a meeting, see the fictional sce- nario at www.cognexus.org/dmepaper.htm [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#8|p. 8]]

fined by Rittel. 5 It has turned out to be a critical development in argumentation-based DR, since it provides a way to negotiate the capture bottleneck: the structure required to construct useful DR is added in real time during the meeting, adding immediate value to the participants, but also creating a record. Mapping ideas in IBIS during a meeting is unquestionably an acquired ability, but equally, one that can be learnt (there is an international Compendium user commu- nity). This was the key oversight in early argumentation-based DR research, which experi- mented with small-scale demonstration examples, and did not invest enough in what we now think of as hypermedia/IBIS ‘literacy’. See Conklin [8] for a longer introduction to the craft skill involved in choreographing meetings and representational activities that we introduce be- low, and [9] for an extended resource. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#9|p. 9]]

The facilitation perspective places the Dialogue Mapper in a potentially very powerful role, quite the opposite of the lowly ‘DR scribe’ whose role runs the risk of relegation to minute- taker or documenter. The mapper actively crafts structures on a shared display screen that both capture the meanings and ideas of the group and reflect back to it the larger implications of their thinking. There is a spectrum of how strongly discourse is mediated via this display (described in the DR continuum [3]). It may be used to periodically summarise and review ‘normal discus- sion’ (e.g. at decision time), screens can be shown to reflect on progress, or the discussion and the map can ‘dance’—each shaping the other. It is hard to convey this in writing, but we con- tend that it exemplifies the kind of synergy between tools and sensemaking that was envisioned by the developers of early ‘idea processing’/DR hypertext systems. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#9|p. 9]]

To borrow a musical metaphor, there are several shifts in the ‘rhythm’ or ‘timbre’ of a meet- ing when Compendium is used well: [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#9|p. 9]]

::Displaying map on screen - people know that their contributions have been noted. Can be "safe" and move on.:: [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#9|p. 9]]

Beneficial slowing down. A complaint sometimes heard when argumentation-based DR is first introduced to meetings, is that it disrupts the flow of the meeting [12][2]. When done ap- propriately, however, we find that it can be extremely beneficial to ‘disrupt’ dysfunctional dynamics by focusing attention on a feature of the hypertext map. After a period of use, peo- ple become noticeably unhappy when their contributions are not mapped, because once cap- tured on screen, they know that their view has been heard, correctly recorded, and will be harder to ignore when the map is assessed at decision time. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#9|p. 9]]

Depersonalization of conflict. When ideas and concerns are mediated via a shared display, challenges to positions assume a more neutral, less personal tone. In situations where there are competing agendas, it helps participants clarify the nature of their disagreement (e.g. the definition of ‘the problem’; understanding different criteria of ‘success’). We have seen Compendium defuse meetings which otherwise looked to be polarized, for instance, by sur- facing the different connotations of a particular question. Recent work with Compendium has deployed specifically in conflict resolution and mediation [23]. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#9|p. 9]]

Flexible rhythmic review. To a surprising degree, collaborative knowledge work can be characterized as “group list processing.” Whether the list is a set of requirements, budget items, or action items, a common activity is group review of a list of potentially complex elements. While some items draw little comment, others can lead into deep discussions and even debate. A good mapper can establish a “call and response” rhythm with the group, creat- ing a sense of shared purpose and momentum. When occasional elements lead to intense dis- cussions about meaning, or spark disagreement among group members, the Compendium practitioner can open a new map and keep mapping or modeling the new conversation. With the new issues captured in the shared display, the group can return to the previous review task without losing momentum. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#9|p. 9]]

The evolution of Compendium from QuestMap and gIBIS has, however, opened the door technically and conceptually for integration with other software engineering tools, and other DR tools. Compendium does not come with any preprogrammed verification services that can per- form structural checking (which could for instance be used to provide a DR service such as de- pendency management). Given the breadth of our user community, which goes beyond just software engineering and design rationale, our strategy has been twofold: (1) to create an open architecture (unlike QuestMap’s) with a standard SQL database, XML DTD, and Java source code to enable other groups to access all levels of the system functionality and data; (2) to pro- vide a visual user interface and generic issue-oriented representational substrate as described above (extended IBIS, a customizable visual language, tags, templates, node reuse, graphs and lists) which can be appropriated to express many different kinds of design knowledge. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#10|p. 10]]

Compendium has been used on over 100 projects during the last 10 years7 some of which are concerned with software and broader socio-technical systems design, though by no means all of them. Readers seeking empirical evidence of the approach’s learnability and effectiveness from analyses of real world cases in the field can review [6][8][22][24][27][28], while close video analysis is found in [26]. Pre-Compendium, video analysis of the QOC approach can be found in [2][3][4]; Conklin has reported on a large deployment of gIBIS [11] and a decade long de- ployment of QuestMap [8], Carr [5] has used QuestMap to teach legal argumentation, while Isenmann and Reuter have reflected on HyperIBIS [17] and Fischer et al [12] on IBIS and PHI. [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#11|p. 11]]

Our second extension to the worked example illustrates a recent dimension to meeting and ra- tionale capture: Compendium integration with meeting videos. In the context of NASA mission planning [6], a multimedia Meeting Replay extension to Compendium was developed to assist the indexing and navigation of the meeting videos to assist one team’s understanding of an- other’s meetings, decisions and rationale [[skimx://buckinghamshum2006hypermedia#13|p. 13]]
