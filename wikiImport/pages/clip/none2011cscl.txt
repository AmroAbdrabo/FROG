Towards Productive Multivocality in the Analysis of Collaborative Learning [[skimx://none2011cscl#42|p. 42]]

The Learning Sciences are too diverse (theoretically and methodologically) for unification to be possible or desirable, but learning scientists would benefit from boundary objects (Star & Griesemer, 1989) that form the basis for dialogue between theoretical and methodological traditions applied to the analysis of learning in and through interaction. The question at hand is what constitutes effective boundary objects and how they may be leveraged. [[skimx://none2011cscl#42|p. 42]]

Boundary objects “have different meanings in [[skimx://none2011cscl#43|p. 43]]

different worlds but their structure is common enough to more than one world to make them recognizable, a means of translation” (Star & Griesemer, 1989, p. 393). [[skimx://none2011cscl#44|p. 44]]

Yet we wanted to explore further how shared frameworks (e.g., Suthers, Dwyer, Medina, & Vatrapu, 2010) and shared analytic software tools (e.g., Tatiana; Dyke, Lund, & Girardot, 2009) could serve as or produce appropriate boundary objects. [[skimx://none2011cscl#44|p. 44]]

The third analyst, Stefan Trausan-Matu, defined pivotal moments in collaboration by detecting changes in the degree of inter-animation of voices as illustrated by collaborative and differential utterances. Collaborative utterances illustrate a convergence pattern and correspond for example to the collective display of understanding already mentioned (Shirouzu’s first pivotal moment and Chiu’s fifth breakpoint). An example of ￼ [[skimx://none2011cscl#44|p. 44]]

a differential utterance is when an explanation given by one learner is perceived as incomplete, thus inciting a second learner to add to it. In the polyphonic view, this exemplifies a type of “dissonance” between the two learners that is remedied by the second learner’s addition. Trausan-Matu used a polyphonic model of group interaction where a conversation contains different longitudinal threads (or “voices”) composed of utterances, each of them having independence, but achieving a joint discourse (Trausan-Matu & Rebedea, 2009) [[skimx://none2011cscl#45|p. 45]]

provides a space in which student partners can record their developing ideas; and tools to promote their critical selection of evidence, strategic organization of information, and construction of coherent, evidence-based explanations. Customizable annotation, tagging, and flagging features prompt students to justify their interactions with the visualizations, to articulate their interpretations of the outcomes, and to make explicit connections between the evidence gathered and different possible explanations for the seasons. Finally, activities with the Idea Manager are designed such that students must negotiate all decisions with partners. Thus, they provide multiple opportunities for students to collaboratively build upon their own and others’ ideas toward more normative understandings. [[skimx://none2011cscl#58|p. 58]]

Learning Evolution through Collaborative Critique-focused Concept Mapping Beat A. Schwendimann, [[skimx://none2011cscl#59|p. 59]]

This study investigates how student dyads learn from an inquiry-based evolution curriculum by either co-constructing concept maps or co-critiquing concept maps. Traditionally, students generate concept maps from scratch, which can be time-consuming and challenging, especially for students with low prior knowledge (Schwendimann, 2008). As an alternative, students receive pre-made concept maps that include commonly found alternative ideas. Concept maps in both treatment groups (generation and critique) consisted of the same concepts and had a drawing area divided into the domain-specific areas of genotype and phenotype to make connections within and across areas explicit. Students had to generate their own criteria to critique the maps and negotiate with their partner on how to revise the map. Pretest and posttest essay items were scored using a five- level knowledge integration rubric (Linn, Lee, Tinker, Husic & Chiu, 2006). Concept maps were scored on a propositional level using the knowledge integration concept map rubric (Schwendimann, 2008) and on a network level. [[skimx://none2011cscl#59|p. 59]]

Findings suggest that collaborative concept map critique activities can be a beneficial alternative to generating concept maps, in particular for students with low pretest knowledge. [[skimx://none2011cscl#59|p. 59]]

also explored the potential for scaffolding to be used to support the development of affect and higher order thinking, such as metacognition (Aleven, et. al., 2004; Harris et al, 2009). [[skimx://none2011cscl#64|p. 64]]

scaffolding of collaboration between learners has also been studied (see for example, Guzdial et al.,1996); Zurita & Nussbaum, 2004). [[skimx://none2011cscl#64|p. 64]]

Computer-supported scripts directly influence the collaborative dialogue, instead of training students prior to the actual collaboration (Schwarz, Asterhan, & Gil, 2009). For example, students are provided with carefully designed scripts to engage in processes such as argumentative knowledge construction (e.g., Weinberger, Stegmaan, Fischer, & Mandl, 2007; Weinberger, Stegmann, & Fischer, 2005), grounding (Schoonenboom, 2008), and so forth in online CSCL environments. Furthermore, Wecker and Fischer (2007) have examined fading the structure by adapting and gradually reducing the specificity of prompts according to the contributions of individual participants, in combination with distributed monitoring and feedback by partners during collaboration. [[skimx://none2011cscl#64|p. 64]]

Reiser (2004), for example, draws a distinction between software scaffolding approaches that aim to structure the learner’s task and those approaches that shape the learner’s performance and ‘problematize’ the task. He envisions the two approaches — structuring and problematizing — working together to scaffold learners. Quintana and colleagues have developed a Scaffolding Design Framework for science inquiry (Quintana et al, 2004; Quintana & Fishman, 2006). The focus is upon the provision of scaffolding support for science inquiry activities and is based upon some key scaffolding processes for science inquiry, it does not however address the problem of fading. [[skimx://none2011cscl#65|p. 65]]

the importance of looking at the context of a learner’s interactions (Wood, Underwood & Avis, 1999). [[skimx://none2011cscl#65|p. 65]]

Little work has explicitly attempted to model a learner’s wider context and the role of technology. Some work within the open learner modelling community has considered lifelong learner modelling (Kay 2009), [[skimx://none2011cscl#66|p. 66]]

Laurillard's conversational framework can be used more broadly with other age groups and settings [[skimx://none2011cscl#67|p. 67]]

Some researchers propose that we look at the ways in which different communities have used the scaffolding concept in order to further develop its theoretical foundations (Davis & Miyake, 2004). Others suggest that we need to look back at the origins of scaffolding and, in particular, to Vygotsky’s conception of learning (Pea, 2004; Puntambekar & Hübscher, 2005). There is a growing body of opinion that fading is a fundamental and intrinsic component of scaffolding (Pea, 2004; Lahore, 2005; Puntambekar & Hübscher, 2005), and that a line needs to be drawn between scaffolding with fading and scaffolding without fading. And suggestions about the benefits and challenges of casting our scaffolding net wider. Puntambekar & Kolodner (2005) for example use the term ‘distributed scaffolding’ and draw our attention to the increased complexity that occurs when scaffolding is distributed and also to the potential for distributed scaffolding to offer learners more scaffolding opportunities. Tabak (2004) also explores complex settings and distributed scaffolding and offers a vision of ‘synergistic scaffolding’, through which learners can take advantage of different types of support provided by different means in an integrated manner, in order to solve complex problems. [[skimx://none2011cscl#67|p. 67]]

she (Puntambekar & Kolodner, 2005), introduced the term distributed scaffolding to refer to the variety of support provided in the complex environment of a classroom. [[skimx://none2011cscl#68|p. 68]]

. Her research found that multiple forms of support—distributed across available tools, activities, and agents in the classroom and integrated in ways that admit redundancy—enhance the learning and performance of a wide variety of students. In a complex classroom environment, it can be difficult to align all the affordances in such a way that every student can recognize and take advantage of all of them. When support is distributed and integrated and takes multiple forms, it is more likely that students will notice and take advantage of the environment’s and activity’s affordances.

When equipped with graphic organizers to help students plan and organize their problem solving, a general technology tool like GS is transformed from a general tool for enabling seamless interactions to a scaffolded software tool integrated with pedagogical design for supporting specific learning, by problematizing important disciplinary content. The distributed nature of the scaffolding is reflected in the support that is distributed across the GS tool, the graphic organizers, the artefacts created, and the different levels of interaction at the individual, intra-group and inter-group levels.

Semantic Organization of Online Discussions for Active Collaborative Learning Author: Yanyan Li, Beijing Normal University [[skimx://none2011cscl#76|p. 76]]

Researchers argue that learners' discussion comprises a series of phases, in terms of collaborative knowledge building: information sharing and comparing, concept exploring and discovering, and negotiation of meaning and construction of knowledge. Nevertheless, most research has show that learners' discussion transcripts actually fall primarily into the first phase of information sharing and comparing, so herein we classify the messages types into Question, Opinion, Suggestion, Recommendation, Request and Citing. [[skimx://none2011cscl#76|p. 76]]

The normal way to analyze the discussion transcripts corpus is to use SNA to count the reply-to relationship between learners, which results in a one-mode network. By adding the topics to which the messages belong, the one-mode network can be transformed into bi-partite network. Additionally, this allows the community to define the knowledge map to express the domain knowledge. By building the semantic mapping from the topics in bi-partite network to concepts in KM, a theme-centered network can be constructed to indicate the persons gathered around one concept. In this way, the theme-centered network denotes the potential interests of the persons, and by adding the reply-to relationship, a special interest group (SIG) can be formed with respect to each concept in the KM. After discovering special interest groups within discussion forums, the next step is to compute criteria for SIG membership, including participation, mutuality and activity. Once a learner becomes a member of a special interest group, he will be informed of other learning companions to enhance the in-depth communication and learning, and any new, emerging information related to the SIG will be proactively pushed to him as well.

A Principle-based Approach to Knowledge Building: Processes, Challenges, and Implications [[skimx://none2011cscl#80|p. 80]]

Collaborative and inquiry-based learning programs vary in the degree of prescription and specification along a continuum from procedure- to principle-based approaches. [[skimx://none2011cscl#80|p. 80]]

At the procedure-based end innovations are translated into school practice through specification of procedures to be faithfully implemented. Principles are not made explicit but must be inferred from procedures that typically involve carefully sequenced activities and curriculum material and pre-established steps, scripts, and prompts. Collaborative inquiry is accordingly structured through setting up fixed small-groups that deal with assigned sub-topics and tasks following provided procedures, scripts, and templates (see Zhang, Scadamalia, Reeve, & Messina, 2009). At the principle-based end principles are made explicit and presented as pedagogical design parameters with teachers and students engaged as designers and innovators to continually invent and improve principle-based practice through analysis of principles, examples, and results in their contexts. At the midpoint is a principle-based procedure approach in which principles are made explicit and best practices are conveyed through pre-established activities and procedures that translate these principles into effective action. Differences among these approaches on the procedure- to principle-based continuum have triggered ongoing debates and dialogues in the learning sciences (Brown & Campione, 1996; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2007) that relate to several specific areas of inquiry, including prescriptive, structured versus adaptive, open instructional design (Schwartz, Lin, Brophy, & Bransford, 1999), scripted versus adaptive collaboration (Dillenbourg, 2002; Zhang, in press; Zhang et al., 2009), fidelity and adaptation of curriculum implementation (Brown & Edelson, 2001; Barab & Luehmann, 2003), adoption and transformation of inquiry-based practices in international and cultural contexts (Chan, 2008; Zhang, 2010), and specification of learning design in design- based research (Dede, 2004). [[skimx://none2011cscl#80|p. 80]]

Brown and Campione (1994) used activity structures such as jigsaw, crosstalk, and benchmark lessons to establish Fostering Communities of Learners classrooms [[skimx://none2011cscl#81|p. 81]]

They noted an important advantage of their approach: “The repetitive, indeed, ritualistic nature of these activities is an essential aspect of the classroom, for it enables children to make the transition from one participation structure...to another quickly and effortlessly.” (p. 236) They also wrote about “lethal mutations” created by the fact that implementers often focus on surface features rather than the underlying principles, thus the procedures themselves became rituals that impede innovativeness (Brown & Campione, 1996).

How Do Co-Learners Build a Collaborative Concept Map Using Visualizations of Their Either Similar or Complementary Prior Knowledge? Gaëlle Molinari, Mirweis Sangin, Marc-Antoine Nüssli, & Pierre Dillenbourg [[skimx://none2011cscl#96|p. 96]]

In the present contribution, we report an exploratory analysis of how co-learners with either similar or complementary prior knowledge use and articulate their personal knowledge maps in a collaborative concept- mapping task. Concept mapping is a technique that can be used for the visualization of knowledge in both individual and collaborative learning settings. [[skimx://none2011cscl#96|p. 96]]

While building the collaborative map, peers were provided with visualizations (in the form of personal concept maps) of both their own- and their partner’s prior knowledge. Personal knowledge maps were constructed by learners themselves after the reading of a text (on the neuron) in a first individual learning phase. Two eye-trackers were used to record peers’ eye movements during the course of collaboration. The aim was to investigate how co-learners distributed their visual attention across the three concept maps (collaborative map, own- and partner’s personal maps). In particular, the question concerned the extent to which peers visually referred to their partner’s map while interacting together (visual transactivity). Action transactivity was also analyzed as being the degree to which co-learners manipulated their partner’s contributions in the collaborative map. [[skimx://none2011cscl#97|p. 97]]

Embedding CSCL in Classrooms: Conceptual and Methodological Challenges of Research on New Learning Spaces [[skimx://none2011cscl#108|p. 108]]

Recent advances in CSCL have emphasized technology frameworks where learning content is added and refined by users dynamically during learning activities, with some learning objects gaining content and definition only through patterns of access and use by students. Such content has been referred to as “Emerging Learning Objects,” and often include a versioning system (i.e., to allow all student changes to be tracked) as well as powerful data mining performed by intelligent software agents (e.g. Slotta & Aleahmad, 2009).

Strengthening the Conceptual Foundations of Knowledge Building Theory and Pedagogy [[skimx://none2011cscl#116|p. 116]]

Outside of education, the concept of knowledge creation has taken shape referring to the same process (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). In fact, “knowledge building” and “knowledge creation” may be treated as equivalent terms (Paavola & Hakkarainen, 2005). [[skimx://none2011cscl#116|p. 116]]

In an educational context, however, it becomes important to establish in what sense students may be thought to create new knowledge (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 2010) [[skimx://none2011cscl#116|p. 116]]

Among the ideas featured in this symposium are “epistemic mediation,” “group cognition,” “improvable ideas,” and a distinction between “belief mode” and “design mode.” [[skimx://none2011cscl#116|p. 116]]

The Role of Epistemic Mediation in Knowledge Building (Hakkarainen, Ritella, & Seitamaa-Hakkarainen) [[skimx://none2011cscl#116|p. 116]]

The evolutionary history of human cognition appears to involve cultural invention of epistemic technologies, such as writing, that radically collectivize cognitive processes traditionally thought of as taking place within the human mind—resulting in what we here discuss as epistemic mediation. By epistemic mediation, we refer to a process of deliberately re-mediating personal or collective inquiry by creating shareable epistemic artifacts, such [[skimx://none2011cscl#116|p. 116]]

as texts, graphs, and models. It involves efforts of crystallizing, integrating, and synthesizing one’s view at the edge of knowledge and understanding and using the resulting knowledge artifacts as a stepping stone for reaching a higher-level understanding at subsequent cycles of inquiry. [[skimx://none2011cscl#117|p. 117]]

The advancement of knowledge-creating inquiry appears to depend on a sustained struggle to crystallize evolving understanding in a growing network of epistemic artifacts. These artifacts, in turn, provide implicit or explicit hints and guidelines regarding promising directions of advancement and ways of going beyond the existing epistemic horizon. From an evolutionary perspective the present tremendous expansion of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is a continuation of the same process of epistemic mediation that took place at the advent of modern civilization and changed the architecture of human cognition as radically as earlier leaps in biological evolution (Donald, 2001). [[skimx://none2011cscl#117|p. 117]]

The principal vehicle of epistemic mediation is writing that allows externalization, objectification, and materialization of the processes of thinking and reasoning for shareable epistemic artifacts in interaction with which subsequent inquiry takes place. As Brockmeyer and Olson (2009) argued, writing is not just recording of thought but constitutes its own system that has significant social, intellectual, and cultural consequences. This system relies on material-symbolic practices that enable creation of new kinds of epistemic objects, such as questions and theories, with which we can be in interaction. In order to elicit pursuit of novelty, knowledge- building inquiry has to capitalize on extended cognitive circuits that break boundaries between minds, bodies, artifacts and environments (Clark, 2008). In order to cultivate capacities of pursuing challenging inquiries, students have to be intellectually socialized to expand and augment their cognitive resources by deliberately working at external memory fields and writing for creating knowledge. As a social practice, writing is mediated by literate genres, i.e., socially and culturally recognizable, ritualized, and repeated production of typified epistemic artifacts in human collectives (Bazerman, 1988; 2004; Prior, 1998). Beyond genres of reporting textbook knowledge, the participants of technology-mediated learning have to learn to master academic writing focused on using writing as a tool of extending their thinking and deliberately generating new ideas and working theories. Epistemic mediation appears both to require and assist formation of a specific kind of identity as a prospective builder and creator of knowledge. [[skimx://none2011cscl#117|p. 117]]

Objects of knowledge appear to have the capacity to unfold infinitely. They are more like open drawers filled with folders extending infinitely into the depth of a dark closet. Since epistemic objects are always in the process of being materially defined, they continually acquire new properties and change the ones they have. But this also means that objects of knowledge can never be fully attained, that they are, if you wish, never quite themselves. (Knorr-Cetina, 2001, p. 181). [[skimx://none2011cscl#117|p. 117]]

Technology-mediated learning environments and corresponding practices provide valuable resources for knowledge-creating inquiry in terms of assisting in building on, synthesizing, and rising above epistemic artifacts created. It appears that CSCL environments are children of hybridization in terms of providing material technology for sustained working with shared digital (but materially embodied) artifacts. Such knowledgeware technologies and associated practices of knowledge building allow working with distributed epistemic artifacts, and, thereby, elicit collectivization of inquiry and learning. Integrating CSCL technologies as instruments of one’s activity is a developmental process in its own right; cultivation of innovative inquiry practices within a learning community is not possible without sustained iterative and expansive efforts at creating an adequate chronotope. Hence, technology enhances learning only through transformed social practices. [[skimx://none2011cscl#117|p. 117]]

Understanding Knowledge Building as a Small-group Cognitive Process (Stahl) [[skimx://none2011cscl#117|p. 117]]

The move from the individual to the group level of description as foundational entails an important philosophical step: from cognitivism to post-cognitivism (Stahl, 2011). Although the literature on small groups and on post-cognitivist phenomena provides illuminating studies of the pivotal role of small groups, it does not account for this level of description theoretically. In the final analysis it is almost always based on either a psychological view of individuals or a sociological view of rules, etc., at the community level. None of the studies has a foundational conception of small groups as a distinct level. They confuse talk at the group level and at the social level, and they lack a developed account of the relationships between individual, group and community. [[skimx://none2011cscl#118|p. 118]]

If we take group phenomena seriously as “first-class objects,” then we can study: interpersonal trains of thought, shared understandings of diagrams, joint problem conceptualizations, common references, coordination of problem-solving efforts, planning, deducing, designing, describing, problem solving, explaining, defining, generalizing, representing, remembering and reflecting as a group. [[skimx://none2011cscl#118|p. 118]]

Improvable Ideas: The Foundation of Knowledge Building (Scardamalia & Bereiter) [[skimx://none2011cscl#118|p. 118]]

It goes almost without saying that idea improvement, insofar as it involves movement from simpler to more complex ideas, is necessarily a self-organizing process. Self-organization is the only viable explanation of how growth in conceptual complexity is achieved (Molenaar, 1986). This is true even when the more complex concept is supposedly conveyed by a lecture or a text: grasping it requires constructive activity on the part of the learner that is equivalent to theory building (Popper & Eccles, 1977, p. 461). But when, as in knowledge building, the students are agents of their own production of more complex conceptual structures, the demands put on a sustained self-organizing process are likely to be greater. The greatest challenge for knowledge- building technology, accordingly, is to support a self-organizing process in the realm of ideas. This is something beyond supporting self-organization at the social level (which the new social media seem to be accomplishing to amazing effect) or self-organization in the planning and conduct of projects (which is the province of project management software and educational adaptations of it). [[skimx://none2011cscl#119|p. 119]]

The approach we are advocating in designing next-generation knowledge-building software is to treat ideas rather than people or actions as the units in a self-organizing system. Social networks evolve and projects and processes evolve. All of these warrant feedback systems to support their evolution. But it is the evolution of ideas that occupies center stage and that these other kinds of evolution subserve. Thus we want to build idea network analysis, comparable to social network analysis; nearest-neighbor searches that identify neighboring ideas, even if they are located in different parts of a database; and ways for students’ judgments of promisingness and importance and for their metacognitive awareness to feed into the process of idea evolution. Knowledge-building dialogue is key, for advances in community knowledge are not merely supported by dialogue but actually take place in it (Tsoukas, 2009). Among other well-known advantages of having discourse carried out online is the fact that it produces something semantic analysis tools can work on and hopefully provide feedback of a kind that will enhance the self-organizing processes of conceptual evolution. [[skimx://none2011cscl#119|p. 119]]

These proposals are in line with a current trend to design self-organizing networks (Rycroft, 2003), whether Internet-based or not. They are at the opposite pole from threaded discourse, which seems almost to have been designed to thwart self-organization—or, at its worst, to thwart organization of any kind. They also stand in contrast to clickers and related kinds of response technology, which can be used in a variety of educationally beneficial ways but which keep the teacher in control of the information flow. Whether idea- centered knowledge-building technology can take advantage of FaceBook and Twitter kinds of technology is a challenge yet to be explored. The challenge may be framed as “sustained creative work with ideas meets short attention span.” [[skimx://none2011cscl#119|p. 119]]

Integrated Tool Support for Learning through Knowledge Creation [[skimx://none2011cscl#122|p. 122]]

In this symposium we discuss pedagogical design involving technology that aims to support and foster learning through object-bound collaboration. [[skimx://none2011cscl#122|p. 122]]

The KPE environment (http://www.knowledgepractices.info) is an integrated, modular open source software. It is designed to enable various visual views on the collaboration process and the related knowledge practices. [[skimx://none2011cscl#122|p. 122]]

learning through development of knowledge objects (e.g., designs, software applications, research reports). [[skimx://none2011cscl#122|p. 122]]

Activities supported by the integrated tools are, for example, co-construction of knowledge, collaborative and iterative writing, conceptual modeling, and reflection of knowledge practices (Lakkala et al., 2009). [[skimx://none2011cscl#122|p. 122]]

In current work practices, multi-professional collaboration is typically organized around long-term efforts for developing shared, tangible knowledge objects such as products, models, articles, or practices (Paavola & Hakkarainen, 2005). [[skimx://none2011cscl#122|p. 122]]

The EU-funded project “Knowledge Practices Laboratory” (KP-Lab) is a response to the described challenge. [[skimx://none2011cscl#122|p. 122]]

The theoretical claim underlying the knowledge creation perspective is that new meaning and understanding of the domain arises through the externalization of knowledge and collaboratively creating knowledge objects that emerge and become transformed over time. In the knowledge creation approach an explicit theoretical account of the social interaction is included, which was not theoretically accounted for in the knowledge building approach (Ludvigsen, 2009). The mediated nature of human activity (see Vygotsky, 1978) is acknowledged in the knowledge creation approach particularly by emphasizing multiple types of technology- mediation; including support for pragmatic, social, epistemic, and reflective types of activities (Lakkala et al., 2009; Paavola & Hakkarainen, 2005; Rabardel & Bourmaud 2003). In this context, technology plays an important role as a mediating element, since it enhances the social interaction between participants and (shared) knowledge objects, and the development of innovative knowledge practices. [[skimx://none2011cscl#123|p. 123]]

The added value of KPE is in the integration of various functionalities to build a multipurpose and flexible collaborative virtual environment, which is designed to support complex activities, both at the epistemic and procedural levels. In KPE, individual and collective shared (work) spaces can be created, e.g., by a project team, students attending a class or members of a multifunctional development team in an organization. Different visualizations are possible: a view of the process, a view of the content, a community view, an alternative process view, and a tailored view. Within these views KPE focuses on supporting the sustained activities around shared objects through offering flexible tools for: a) joint elaboration, versioning and visual organization of content; b) object-bound commenting and chatting; c) use of semantics in content specific searching, conceptual modelling, tagging, and explicating relationships between various knowledge items; d) awareness of other users’ participation and status in knowledge creation processed supported by KPE, and e) management and organization of the groups’ practices (see images in Figure 1). KPE also provides analytic tools for automatic analysis of collaborative work and development of shared objects. The analytic tools offer possibilities for students, teachers, and researchers to visualize and reflect on the knowledge creation processes and provide reference points for practice transformation.

Enhancing the Social and Cognitive Benefits of Digital Tools and Media [[skimx://none2011cscl#139|p. 139]]

We occasionally see sustained idea development in blogs, but this is usually because the blogger has chosen to use the medium as a thinker’s notebook. Typically such blog entries are monologues, sometimes with comments from others, sometimes not. [[skimx://none2011cscl#139|p. 139]]

The Teacher’s Role in Developing the Socio-cognitive Infrastructure for Progressive Collaborative Inquiry (Viilo, Seitamaa-Hakkarainen, & Hakkarainen) F [[skimx://none2011cscl#140|p. 140]]

In addition to a technological infrastructure and a suitable social infrastructure, progressive collaborative inquiry requires an epistemic infrastructure, within which knowledge is treated as something that can be shared and jointly developed by participants, and a cognitive infrastructure of knowledge practices— ways of working with knowledge and ideas and their embodiments in various media objects. Hakkarainen and colleagues have developed a pedagogical model of progressive-inquiry (PI) learning model (Hakkarainen, 2003; 2004), inspired by Scardamalia and Bereiter’s (2006) knowledge-building framework. The PI model is a tool that assists teachers in engaging their students in expert-like creative knowledge practices. The idea is that the teachers should guide students themselves to assume responsibility for all aspects of inquiry, such as goal- setting, questioning, explaining, and evaluating; they must guide students’ process of inquiry by their own example. The model consists of several elements that constitute essential aspects of a cyclic process of solving problems and advancing local, collective knowledge. Shared expertise means that the participants of knowledge creating inquiry are not isolated individuals but a classroom learning community that pursues joint investigation by sharing all elements of progressive inquiry. Construction of working theories guides the participants to stretch their knowledge and understanding for creating shared epistemic artifacts for supporting subsequent inquiry efforts. By critically evaluating their advancement, individuals, teams, and the whole inquiry community are able to focus their subsequent inquiry efforts toward promising directions. The question-driven process of inquiry provides heuristic guidance in the search for new information for directions and sources not determined by the teachers or initially anticipated by the participants. The process of inquiry starts with initially very general, unspecified and “fuzzy” questions and tentative working theories; advancement of inquiry entails that the participants focus on improving their ideas by generating more specific questions and searching for new information for directing further investigations (Hakkarainen & Sintonen, 2002).

Generic Improvements in Communication Technology to Enhance Socio-cognitive Gains (Chuy, Chen, Resendes, van Aalst, Chan, Scardamalia, & Bereiter) [[skimx://none2011cscl#143|p. 143]]

Drawing on wide-ranging research on technologically supported knowledge building (most recently consolidated in a special issue of the Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology), we here discuss generic improvements in technology that could enhance socio-cognitive benefits. [[skimx://none2011cscl#143|p. 143]]

Generic improvements would include the following: • Easy ways to reference other participants’ ideas. With traditional threaded discourse technology, this can only be done by attaching a comment to a specific post. (Often even this facility is lacking, so that a respondent has to copy and paste part of the message being referred to. Continued discussion means further copying and pasting, to the point where the exchange becomes virtually unreadable.) Integrative knowledge building requires being able to reference several items, including different people’s contributions as well as outside information sources, and to build on those. • Ability to draw ideas together into a higher level of idea organization. • Ability to use different media in representing ideas without segregating them into different applications; e.g., being able to incorporate a simulation into a verbal explanation. • Rich and abundant feedback and visualization mechanisms that enable a variety of “metacognitive views” (Brown & Campione, 1996) on an unfolding discourse. [[skimx://none2011cscl#143|p. 143]]

Advancing the Design of Knowledge-building Software (Chen, Resendes, Chuy, Bielaczyc, Hong, Scardamalia, & Bereiter) [[skimx://none2011cscl#143|p. 143]]

(a) supports for capturing the key ideas in notes and flexibly characterizing them; (b) scaffolds to raise the discourse to increasingly high levels, (c) visualizations to focus attention on a subset of notes with a specific goal for advancing collective work, and (d) concurrent evaluation that can become part of an ongoing knowledge-building process. [[skimx://none2011cscl#144|p. 144]]

Up to this time, a simple set of theory-building scaffolds has carried the main burden of partially structuring knowledge-building discourse (“My theory...,” “I need to understand...,” “A better theory...,” etc.). The current effort is to provide more complex scaffolding based on a model of “good moves” in problem-solving dialogue. For example, one set of scaffolds will promote a metacognitive view of the dialogue’s progress. Students might use the following scaffolds to analyze their progress: “An idea that represents our point of greatest progress,” “A misconception hampering progress...,” “We haven’t followed through with....” Note the emphasis on how “we” are doing, in contrast to the more individualistic emphasis of the original scaffolds. [[skimx://none2011cscl#144|p. 144]]

In our experience the form of visualization users have found most helpful is one that filters out all notes other than those that meet a small number of criteria so that the visualization dramatically lowers the amount of information to be processed. [[skimx://none2011cscl#144|p. 144]]
