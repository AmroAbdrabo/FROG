For a more in-depth overview, the interested reader is invited to read the articles in the three special issues of education journals published in 2003 and 2004: Journal of the Learning Sciences, vol. 13, no. 1; Educational Researcher, vol. 32, no. 1; and Educational Psychologist, vol. 39, no. 4.

Ann Brown (1992), the American researcher credited with first developing DBR, noted that “an effective intervention should be able to migrate from our experimental classroom to average class- rooms operated by and for average students and teachers, sup- ported by realistic technological and personal support” (p. 143). [[skimx://anderson2012design-based#2|p. 2]]

Mingfong, Yam San, and Ek Ming (2010) identified four design characteristics that they sug- gest must be aligned to create effective interventions. These are “frameworks for learning, the affordances of the chosen instruc- tional tools, domain knowledge presentation, and contextual limitations” (p. 470). [[skimx://anderson2012design-based#2|p. 2]]

We should note that the terms “design-research” (Oha & Reeves, 2010) and “develop- ment research” (Conceicao, Sherry, & Gibson, 2004; Oha & Reeves, 2010) also have been used to describe this methodology, but we use the more popular term design-based research in this [[skimx://anderson2012design-based#2|p. 2]]

As an example, this differentiation between grand theories and “theories that work” was picked up by Tiberghien, Vince, and Gaidioz (2009) as they derived a theoreti- cal model for DBR but restricted its dominion to very practical constraints and the specific context of physics instruction.

Involving a Collaborative Partnership Between Researchers and Practitioners [[skimx://anderson2012design-based#3|p. 3]]

Designs evolve from and lead to the development of practical design principles, patterns, and/or grounded theorizing. The focus on theoretical understanding is implied in the fourth and final phase of a DBR study, which Reeves (2000) referred to as “reflection to produce design principles and enhance solution implementation” (p. 9). [[skimx://anderson2012design-based#3|p. 3]]

Herrington, McKenney, Reeves, and Oliver (2007) addressed this concern head-on in an article demonstrating ways in which DBR can be used as a basis for a doctoral dissertation over a four-year period. [[skimx://anderson2012design-based#4|p. 4]]

A number of ways have been suggested to minimize this con- cern in DBR as well as in other qualitative methods (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2007 [[skimx://anderson2012design-based#4|p. 4]]

Data from the 47 articles selected (5 articles each year from 2003 to 2011 and 2 articles from 2002) were entered into a spread- sheet; the graphs and analyses presented in the following sections are derived from this compilation. The spreadsheet is available for further analysis (and reader comments; for further details, see sup- plemental document available on the journal website).
