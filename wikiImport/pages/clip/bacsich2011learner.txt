Findings [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#3|p. 3]]

The literature on learner use of online educational resources is very immature, with a lack of meta-reviews. The overwhelming majority of published studies do not generalise beyond their particular contexts of study. There is no consistent methodology. [O.21, O.25.c/h, O.26] [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#3|p. 3]]

There are significant gaps in the literature: there are almost no meso-level studies, no international comparisons, and very little on learners other than university undergraduates. [O.19 and O.25.h; O.25.d/c/g; O.18, O.35] [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#3|p. 3]]

Only one key study could be found that demonstrated OER having an impact on student attainment. [O.42, 5.4.2.C] [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#3|p. 3]]

3. An Open Educational Bibliography of OER: A comprehensive open and editable bibliography of papers and other literature on all aspects of OER should be generated. (The current project can be regarded as a pilot of this.) [O.49] [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#4|p. 4]]

Section 1: Background [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#5|p. 5]]

1. Sero Consulting Ltd was asked by the Higher Education Academy to undertake a literature review “to provide a greater understanding of the ways in which learners, whether or not in formal education, use online resources to aid their learning experiences and the factors which influence the selection of resources”. It was anticipated that “collectively this work will enable practitioners, policy makers and researchers to adopt more effective evidence-informed or research-informed approaches to their decision-making, research and practice on matters relating to the use of open-educational resources in learning and teaching”. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#5|p. 5]]

2. Twelve areas of interest for the research were proposed by the HEA: learners’ rationale for searching for online resources; types of online resources being sought; complexity/granularity of resources being sought; how resources found are used; whether learners in some subject areas appear to conduct more searches for online resources than others; educational level of resources being sought; location of resources; extent to which resources are the principal or a supplementary source of learning materials; whether or not learners are in formal education; enablers and barriers to use of online resources; how learners retain access to the resources; and provenance information and copyright status of resources being used. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#5|p. 5]]

3. There were two key outputs of which the first was to be a literature review, “to contain an executive summary; outline of methodological approach; identification, selection and analysis of the literature; conceptual perspectives; findings; conclusions, implications and recommendations; and references”. That is this document. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#5|p. 5]]

4. The second key output was to be “a database of literature which is relevant to the review topic and which can be made available by the HEA and JISC to the sector as a searchable resource to facilitate the identification of literature by researchers and practitioners in the future”. After further discussion it was agreed to use Mendeley, a newish low-cost reference management and social networking system developed in the UK. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#5|p. 5]]

12. Two Mendeley groups were set up core to the project: Learner Use of OER and Learner Use of non-OER Online Resources. Other groups were set up round this for less relevant OER material and to support community building. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#6|p. 6]]

15. A long list of search keywords was evolved – OER; OERs; open educational resources; open educational; open resources; open content; education; digital textbooks; (university) digital library users; open/free digital textbooks; (digital) information-seeking behaviour; information seeking; information behaviour; digital information literacy; digital information behaviour; information; research; online; online research; internet; internet research; e-books; e-textbooks; e-journals; student(s); learner(s); user(s); end users; use; student use; student experience; student perceptions; Wikipedia; google; merlot; iTunes U; RLO; RLOs; digital; digital library; digital/information literacy; impact; evidence; scaffolding; digital natives/immigrants; millennials – and variants to cover US spellings. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#6|p. 6]]

18. Thanks to the tagging system a number of contextual variables were captured – country of relevance, educational level, subject etc. There was a preponderance of material about university students and even many of the informal learning examples were about informal learning of individuals who were or wanted to be or had been university students. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#7|p. 7]]

21. Judged from the perspective of learner use, there is a significant disconnect between the OER community and the elite of the e-learning research community – with a few notable exceptions. We have no reason to believe that this would be different in other areas of OER scholarship/research. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#7|p. 7]]

23. The first section is a meta-analysis of all the JISC/HEA OER Programme Pilot Project reports and associated analyses, but it was felt convenient to include OpenLearn also. There are 29 OER Pilot projects and also 201 RePRODUCE projects, making 49 in all. These entries are all in the Learner Use of OER group, but tagged to identify them separately. OTTER was particularly notable in having done a student survey. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#7|p. 7]]

24. The second section is in essence an annotated bibliography of 80 key OER papers, analysed over the five levels of relevance in appropriate detail. Only levels 3, 4, and 5 are in this section – the lower levels are devolved to Appendix 4. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#7|p. 7]]

c) We have the sense that numerous learner use authors do not consider themselves part of (or connected to) the more active OER community. Their publications, therefore, often stand alone, lacking bibliographies of great scale or relevance to a researcher. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#8|p. 8]]

h) Studies involving human subjects tend to focus on the experiences of either small clusters of three to 100 students (typically under 50), or broad swathes of users (upwards of 3,000). Data may be collected through a combination of interviews; surveys; observation; focus groups; assessment; metrics; user logs; emails; and other means. There is little uniformity in methodology here, and so it is difficult to compare these studies and their results. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#8|p. 8]]

27. The third and final section looks at learner use of non-OER online resources. Again it is in essence an annotated bibliography of 153 key non-OER papers, analysed over the five levels of relevance in appropriate detail. Only levels 3, 4, and 5 are in the section – the lower levels are devolved to Appendix 4. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#9|p. 9]]

30. Learners’ rationale for searching for online resources: The OER literature is dominated by the large open university2 and MIT studies. It is debatable how applicable these are to the generality of UK universities and their students. The non-OER literature typically addresses this issue from the standpoint of assessment-driven student behaviour. There is clear room for studies looking at the middle ground. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#9|p. 9]]

32. Complexity/granularity of resources being sought: OER studies tended to confirm the tension between specificity and potential for reuse (seen since the early days of RLOs). Also, students want narrative structure in, or above, the resources they use. The non-OER literature seems to focus more on students typically seeking a single item per search and hints at the assessmentdriven paradigm again – or filling in gaps in an existing narrative not creating their own. It is tempting to draw the conclusion that the two types of study are in fact addressing two different student populations. Again there is clear room for studies looking at the middle ground. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#9|p. 9]]

LUOERL final report 39. Enablers and barriers to use of online resources: It remains true across the wider research that most of the barriers to the use of OER are the same as/or a consequence of more generic barriers to accessing and using technologies for learning. However, the issues of designing learning for the unknown user and the tensions between granularity and the need for scaffolding permeate much of the research. Esslemont (2007) puts it pithily: “There are several interlinked issues related to completeness of content, granularity, copyright, offline access, use, etc., that sometimes limit the effectiveness of material provided. Therefore in order to support the learner we need to understand and support ... the learner’s limitations in terms of content selection, access, use and management of their personal knowledge silos on their desktop.” [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#11|p. 11]]

In the non-OER area one of the biggest issues was that very few papers dealt with the learner use of content27. Researchers seem far more comfortable dealing with learner interactions with systems, other students or in some cases tutors. Content seems rather passé to researchers, as if constructivism had won when it clearly has not – and even less so at pre-tertiary level. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#30|p. 30]]

Thus when reviewing the TALL Mindmap it was obvious that the ‘learner use’ aspect is just a small spot of a big network28. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#30|p. 30]]

Students seem to have a very operational view of OER as ‘stuff I can access’. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#30|p. 30]]

28 http://www.mindmeister.com/76726554/oer-use-reuse-landscape [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#30|p. 30]]

4.2 Key contextual variables [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#32|p. 32]]

By contextual variable we mean a variable in the environment surrounding the learner or a variable aspect of the learner known prior to their engagement with a mode of learning – such as age, sex, ethnicity, previous educational level, etc. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#32|p. 32]]

There is a fascinating study by KERIS that looks at contextual variables for national OER uptake32. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#32|p. 32]]


  *  previous educational level; 
  *  subject wished to be studied; 
  *  level of prior information literacy (along some dimension of ‘digital native’). [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#33|p. 33]]

There are many examples of studies looking at these in section 5. However, and interestingly, we do not find many studies looking at age, sex, language (or language competence) or ethnicity, in the way one would find in many broader studies of ICT uptake – and would have found to an even greater extent even decades ago. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#33|p. 33]]

There were, however, several notable exceptions among which were: [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#35|p. 35]]


  *  the OTTER (Leicester) project, where 71 learners responded to a learner use survey; [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#35|p. 35]]


  *  ChemistryFM (Lincoln), BERLiN (Nottingham) and OER ADM (Brighton), where students were involved in content creation; [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#35|p. 35]]


  *  Open Space (University College Falmouth), where students were encouraged to collaborate and manipulate resources. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#35|p. 35]]

the OpenSpace project: ... found that independent informal learners did not want to be strongly guided through materials, and implemented a more flexible navigation structure that enabled easy movement back and forth38... [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#36|p. 36]]

They have also noted that many independent learners want to dip in, just to resources that are of immediate relevance to them, rather than to follow a set path through a [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#36|p. 36]]

LUOERL final report unit of study. Projects see this as a more learner-centric approach, that has implications for the way they structure their OERs39. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#37|p. 37]]

The overwhelmingly positive feedback to the resources across both programmes is encouraging but as stated above rarely proves (from the student perspective) the additional merit of OER. Much of the feedback could apply to closed and/or proprietary online resources. That is to say, much of the enthusiasm is generated either by the ability to access materials away from the classroom/campus or pre-/without enrolment. However, the feedback and other achievement and retention data indicate at the very least ‘no harm done’. Taken in the context of the potential of OER to expand choice through tailored offers this looks significant. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#42|p. 42]]

1. DESIGNING FOR INNOVATION AROUND OER (IN JIME SPECIAL), by Andy Lane66 [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#44|p. 44]]

Abstract: This paper argues that designing collections of ‘closed’ educational resources (content and technologies) for use by specific student cohorts and collections of open educational resources for use by any ‘learner’ require different design approaches ... there appears to be a paradox in that learning design assumes a reasonably well-known and well-defined student audience with presumed learning needs and mediating technologies while OER are exposed to a multitude of potential learners, both formal and informal, with unknown learning needs and using diverse technologies ... it is necessary to design for greater flexibility so as to allow the users to adapt their use of the innovative solution for their own requirements once it has been deployed. The use of such an ‘innofusion’ approach for OER is highlighted using the case study of OpenLearn. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#44|p. 44]]

The scale of the impact of these six trends on education is difficult to predict as they have emerged at a fairly rapid rate and without any end in sight to such developments. Will many people actually construct their own, personal learning experiences? Will many modify what others have produced? However in terms of enabling innovation these different factors do allow learners to make such choices if they wish. They are not as constrained by pre-defined products and processes and can experiment as much as they might want to. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#44|p. 44]]

[[skimx://bacsich2011learner#44|p. 44]]

In other words, when we expand our literature search behind the scope of JISC/HEA OER, we find that – although there have been several thousand69 papers published that address some aspect of OER – there is a surprisingly limited selection of studies and publications directly (and primarily) addressing the topic of ‘learner use’. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#46|p. 46]]

We have found only about 80 additional publications deemed as directly relevant to the topic. (For more details see section 3.) That said, these items examine the experiences of individuals exposed to a fairly broad and representative range of open content initiatives and programmes, and we have been able to extract some healthy conclusions in section 5.2.5 below. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#46|p. 46]]

Here we see OERs that are largely programme-specific, e.g. they have been produced in conjunction with a particular university course; studies tend to stay close to home, i.e. to examine a local user population. [[skimx://bacsich2011learner#47|p. 47]]

5. ‘Open Content: when is it effective educationally?’ (Lane 2007) delivers a well-researched and well-cited general analysis of learner-content interaction (and other topics).

Non-OER: The research literature we have analysed seems silent on this topic but it is known that for at least ten years there have been online courses (and not only at open universities) where online resources form the principal source of learning materials74.
