This paper examines how emergent technologies could influence the design of learning en- vironments. It will pay particular attention to the roles of educators and learners in creating networked learning experiences on massive open online courses (MOOCs). The research shows that it is possible to move from a pedagogy of abundance to a pedagogy that sup- ports human beings in their learning through the active creation of resources and learning places by both learners and course facilitators. This pedagogy is based on the building of connections, collaborations, and the exchange of resources between people, the building of a community of learners, and the harnessing of information flows on networks. This reso- nates with the notion of emergent learning as learning in which actors and system co-evolve within a MOOC and where the level of presence of actors on the MOOC influences learning outcomes.

This paper will examine how emergent technologies might influence the design of the learn- ing environment and in particular the roles of educators and learners in creating learning experiences on online networked learning environments. It will do this through the lens of a case study of massive open online courses. [[skimx://tooby19957#2|p. 2]]

There is a relation between these forms of presence (Annand, 2011) if we connect Garrison and Andersonâ€™s findings related to presence to the model of learning on an open networked environment in Figure 1. It becomes clear that social presence and cognitive presence could easily form part of the learning experience of a learner in such an environment through the formation and engagement both in communities and, more loosely, on networks.
