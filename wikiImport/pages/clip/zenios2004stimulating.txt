Computer-mediated communication (CMC), has the potential to contribute in innovatory ways to professional development. Particular examples are seen in the area of teacher education where new opportunities for collaboration among learners can emerge (Schrum, 1992; Singletary & Anderson, 1995; Hall, 1997; Leach, 1997; Lewis et al., 1997; Moon, 1997). It has been sug- gested that CMC environments can provide forums for discussing aspects of teaching, developing common professional interests and raising concerns with colleagues (Pearson & Selinger, 1999).

Governments see education, through schooling and lifelong learning, needing to be at the core of the knowledge and network revolution. For example, in 2000, the European Commission brought together a number of strategic action areas in order to develop networked centers for acquiring knowledge through the implementation of CMC technologies. This initiative encour- ages the networking of universities, schools and cultural resource centers and it favors sharing of best practice in education and distance learning. The incorporation of CMC technologies in education is seen as a fundamental prerequisite in the construction of a dynamic, competitive and economically [[skimx://zenios2004stimulating#2|p. 2]]

it provides certain recommendations for understanding learning that enrich previous research on professional development. These recommendations, in particular, provide a guide about what to pay attention to, in thinking about teacher professional development. The term ‘community of practice’ implies participation in a system through which learners share understandings con- cerning what they are involved with and what that means in their lives and for their communities. In that sense, the community of practice constitutes a set of relations between persons, activity and the wider world (Lave & Wenger, 1991). The sociocultural theory of learning starts with the assumption that en- gagement with the practices of a community develops learning. In that sense, learning is by no means an individual process separated from the context of the lived experience of participation in the world. [[skimx://zenios2004stimulating#3|p. 3]]
