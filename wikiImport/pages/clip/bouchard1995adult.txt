ABSTRACT: It is possible to identify certain trends in adult education r~search in Canadian universities. There are areas ofintense activity, as well as some important gaps in research interests. Significant polarizations were found between the various organizations' views ofthe purposes and applications ofresearch in adult education. [[skimx://bouchard1995adult#2|p. 2]]

larger, better endowed Canadian universities have declared their attachment to such goals as "excellence" and "distinction", while other institutions have expressed values that are more commonly in tune with social development and community service. It appears that the more elitist aims ("distinction", "excellence", etc.) tend to foster competitive environments for researchers, and to attract more research funds. On the other hand, institutions that are committed to "wider access", and that deScribe themselves as "community oriented" hold a lower priority when it comes to securing support from granting agencies. This phenomenon is so widespread that we can legitimately-speak oftwo "classes" ofinstitutions, one ofthem having better access to research funds than the other. [[skimx://bouchard1995adult#3|p. 3]]

ful grantsmanship. (How many doctoral students have YOU supervised in the past?) Another significant organizational variable with an impact on research seems to be the departmental and disciplinary affiliation ofthe researchers. In Canadian universities, specific departmental units that specialize in adult education have been vanishing at an alarming rate. Rather, the trend in the past years has been to integrate adult education within the structures of other departments such as Education, Extension, Counseling, etc. This tendency has resulted in the polarization o f interests between researchers who profess an allegiance to the historical emancipatory purposes o f adult education in Canada, and those involved with the daily concernsÂ· ofperformance-oriented training programs and methods. This split between "rational-technical", and "ethical-transformative" purposes ofadult education has been observed, among others, by Blunt (1993). It seems that the integration ofadult education within other administrative units translates into less basic and emancipatory research, and more applied research.
