h1. Comps

h2. Plan going forwards:
  * list of people (like Wesch) and articles/readings that I need to "process", including instructional design approaches that I come across
  * scour the web for these - including Laurillard's article, Athabasca paper etc
  * begin mapping the approaches, and looking for citeable literature on the ones that are important
  * prepare ethics proposal before weekend
  * look for articles on how the way you teach someone changes the structure of their learning
  * instructional design principles/deeper theory? who to ask about this?

h2. Basic idea
How to use digital devices (mobile + laptop) and large displays, as well as new pedagogical scripts, to enable more collaborative and inquiry-based learning in large undergraduate lectures?

h2. Research questions
  * How can we make a large undergraduate lecture more "seminar-like"
    * What are the pre-requisites for effective learning in a seminar?
  * Are there ways in which the large number of people in the same room at the same time can create unique learning opportunities, that could not happen in a small seminar?
    * crowd-sourcing, wisdom of the crowds etc
  * How can what is done in-class be supported by work done between classes, online (hybrid)?
  * How can the learning be evaluated, analyzed, captured? 

h2. Bodies of literature
  * [[Audience response systems]] (clickers, UnderstoodIt, etc)
  * [[Scholarship of Teaching and Learning]] (right now under [[Higher Education Pedagogy]])
    * [[Pedagogical content knowledge]]
  * [[Flipped classrooms]]
  * [[Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning]] and [[Learning Sciences]]
    * [[Scripting]], [[KCI]]
