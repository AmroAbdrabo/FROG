h2. Research
I focus on how people learn about complex phenomena and how technology can help support that learning.  As part of this work, I study problem-based learning, collaborative knowledge construction, and computer supported collaborative learning.   I study the role of technology to support social  knowledge construction and collaborative learning and problem-solving. My research  investigates scaffolded support for problem-based learning, the use of video for learning,  and complex systems understanding.
