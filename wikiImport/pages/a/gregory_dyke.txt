h2. Research
My work focusses on how to support analysis of CSCL data. We are currently building a tool called Tatiana (Trace analysis tool for interaction analysts) which aims to assist an iterative analysis process whereby researchers progressively create artefacts that, together, evidence or increase their understanding of their corpus. My post-doc work has continued the work begun in my PhD with additional thrusts into Data Mining, Epistemologies of CSCL and computational methods for taking time into account in the analysis of small group processes.
