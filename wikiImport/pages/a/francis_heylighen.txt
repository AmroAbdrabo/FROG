h2. About
The main focus of my research is the evolution of complexity: how do higher forms of organization originate and develop? How do systems self-organize, adapt and achieve some form of cognition? I have worked in particular on the development of collective knowledge and intelligence, and its application to the emerging intelligent web, or "global brain". More recently, I have been looking at how individual agents tackle complex challenges via action, exploration, and learning.
