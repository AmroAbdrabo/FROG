h2. Research
Jeremy's research examines the design and classroom use of innovations that enhance learning of complex and conceptually difficult ideas in mathematics and science. Through cognitive science-based research on the "Envisioning Machine" and later "SimCalc," he has explored how computer-based representations can make the mathematics of change and the related physics of motion accessible to many more students. Two running themes in his work are the study of collaboration in learning and the appropriate use of advanced or emerging technologies (such as component software and wireless handhelds) in education. More recently, Jeremy has been addressing large-scale use of innovative technologies in education, both through consulting to companies with a large impact in the market, such as Texas Instruments, Apple, and Scholastic, and through implementation research on scaling up SimCalc to a wide variety of teachers and classrooms.
