Co-Applicant Bonnie Stewart is a member of UPEIâ€™s inaugural PhD cohort in Educational Studies. Her work explores the mutual constitution of knowledge and technologies, epistemologies of the digital, and post-cyborg conceptions of branding and identity performance. A longtime blogger, she is particularly interested in the lived experience of immersion within social media, and the concepts of self and learner that circulate within the discourses of the digital and creative economies.
