h2. About 
I use design-based research methods and situative theories of cognition to improve instruction.  I focus on participatory approaches to assessment and motivation, and work in e-learning, videogaming, and new media contexts. In 2011, I am mostly focusing on a comprehensive model called Designing for Participation (DFP).  DFP is a design-based model for directly fostering participation that also leads to enduring understanding and increased achievement.  I also teach graduate courses in the Learning Sciences program.
