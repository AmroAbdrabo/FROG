h2. Research
Annemarie Sullivan Palincsarâ€™s research focuses on the design of learning environments that support self-regulation in learning activity, especially for children who experience difficulty learning in school; she has studied how children use literacy in the context of guided inquiry science instruction, what types of text support children's inquiry, and what support students who are identified as atypical learners require to be successful in this instruction. She has investigated the use of a hypermedia tool (called EASE-C) to support bringing to scale knowledge and practice regarding text comprehension instruction. She has studied the role of computer-assisted instruction in enhancing children's understanding of subject matter text and web-based text.
