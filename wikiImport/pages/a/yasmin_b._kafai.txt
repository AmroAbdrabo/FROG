As a learning scientist, Dr. Kafai examines technology designs and cultures through the lens of constructionist theory. Her early work, published in Minds in Play: Computer Game Design as a Context for Childrenâ€™s Learning (1995), set the foundation for programmatic initiatives on games and learning in the United States and Europe. Her recent book edition of Beyond Barbie and Mortal Kombat: New Perspectives on Gender and Gaming (2008) presented new developments in gender and gaming.

Dr. Kafaiâ€™s recent collaborations with colleagues from the MIT Media Laboratory have resulted in the design and study of the media-rich programming environment Scratch (scratch.mit.edu) for Computer Clubhouses, a worldwide network of community technology centers. Dr. Kafai is currently investigating how media arts design and programming can become part of curricular activities in school and in after-school programs.

With support of the National Science Foundation and now the MacArthur Foundation, Dr. Kafai is studying daily life and learning opportunities in Whyville.net, a virtual world that is home to over 3.3 million players ages 8-16 years. An upcoming special issue edited for Games & Culture will present findings on collaborative play, representations of race, cheating practices, economic interactions, and involvement in virtual epidemics. Current investigations focus on tweensâ€™ gender play, romantic relationships, and transgressive practices.
