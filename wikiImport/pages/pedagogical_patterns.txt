h1. Pedagogical patterns
(sequences of interactions - [@debarger2010teaching])

integrate info from [[pattern_language_in_education]]

h2. Learning modeling languages
  * [[CML]] (doesn't exist)
  * [[COML]] (builds on CML, for [[GroupScribbles]], one-to-one classroom)
  * [[SCORM]] (online, only student-content)
  * [[IMS-LD]] (online, more flexible pedagogy, XML)
  * [[S-COL]] (system to run script on any web-based platform)
  * [[SCY]] - how generic can SCY become?
  * [[EML]] - educational modeling language, by OU NL

h3. References
  * [@brecht2002cml] - introducing CML, ClassSync Modeling Language - contingent/adaptable teaching, "act as artifact" (capturing and reusing ephemeral scripts). Teacher as theatre director, very teacher oriented. Distributed handhelds, network of actors, resources, networks.
  * [@karampiperis2005designing] - briefly introduces [[SCORM]] and [[IMS-LD]], mentions problems with non-SCORM compliant tools. SCORM is only student-content, IMS-LD supports many pedagogies. Introduces tool to author IMS-LD packages. 
  * [@weinbrenner2007ontologybased] - ontology, [[SCY]], visual design, ELOs
  * [@dejong2010learning] - introducing [[SCY]]
  * [@bote2008gridcole] - Gridcole, reads IMS-LD scripts and enables use of grid-resources (supercomputers etc)
  * [@koper2004educational] - EML, by OU NL, XML-based tool for expressing learning, with "meta-pedagogical analysis"

h2. Patterns

h2. Scripts
  * [@dillenbourg2002over] - over-scripting of CSCL
  * [@wecker2010scol] - S-COL, using javascript to overlay scripting interface on any web-based system. Could for example [[COML]] ([@niramitranon2006coml]) be connected to S-COL? Although one is intended for physical classrooms, and one for entirely online.
