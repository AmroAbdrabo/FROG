As a whole, you have to have at least one year work experience, doesn't matter part time or full time but it has to be continuous and have to a have at least a total of 1950hrs work experience [[http://localhost:9292/%20TA%20|]]

Also, for people who're in Toronto, you probably have to go to 777 Bay for the OHIP application. I went to one other office first but they said for this type of new application which only covers 1 year of OHIP, I must go to the head office which is the 777 Bay. [[http://localhost:9292/toronto|]]
