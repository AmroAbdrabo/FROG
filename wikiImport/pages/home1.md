There are several important articles on the topic of Knowledge Building.
Scardamalia (2003) discusses the crisis in public education, and
Scardamalia and Bereiter (1983) explains why we have to use Knowledge
Forum to achieve a measure of success. Together with Azevedo (2009),
they conclude that we have to remember to:

-   write letters
-   tell our parents (Scardamalia and Bereiter 1992). Scardamalia (1992)
    also says something else.
-   sleep well at night
