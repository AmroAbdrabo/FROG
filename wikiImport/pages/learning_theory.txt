h1. Learning Theory

And, actually, a note on terminology. To me, these - constructivism, critical pedagogy, instructivism - are educational theories, or perhaps instructional theories. They do not describe how learning takes place. Learning is the formation of connections between nodes in a networks. A 'learning theory' describes a process that fosters the formation of these connections, such as Hebbian Associationism, Back Propagation, or Boltzmann mechanisms.
