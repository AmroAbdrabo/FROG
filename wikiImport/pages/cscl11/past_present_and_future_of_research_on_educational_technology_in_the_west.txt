h1. Past, present and future of research on educational technology in the West

h2. Past: Roots of CSCL (expanding vision)
h3. Schematic histories of educational technology
h4. Education
  * Sciences and liberal arts
  * Universal public education
  * Progressive education
  * Creative exploration
  * Small-group collaborative learning
  * Project-based learning
  * Problem-based learning
  * Collaborative learning and CSCL

transfer of facts -> ability to construct knowledge & communicate understanding 

h4. Theory
see [[connecting_levels_of_learning_in_networked_communities#philosophy_unit_of_analysis|this]]

h4. Computer technology
  * mainframes
  * custom applications for corporations
  * generic desktop applications
  * computer networking and groupware
  * small apps for devices
  * social networking media, cloud and ubiquitous computing

from isolated machines -> social infrastructures

h4. Software design

  * techno-centric
  * ergonomics and human factors
  * human-centered design
  * design-based research
  * social informatics
  * socio-technical design

expanded to stress how technology would be enacted, adopted, disseminated and used in practice 

h4. Educational applications
  * 1950s: cooperative learning in groups
  * 1960s: computer-assisted instruction (arithmetic drill etc)
  * 1970s: intelligent tutoring systems (user modeling algebra misconceptions)
  * 1980s: LOGO as latin - simple programming language that students could use to create small applications, student-centered approach, allow students to be creative. Still working individually.
  * 1990s: CSCL (eg. [[:t:Knowledge Forum|CSILE]])

from individuals acquiring facts to communities building knowledge

h3. Role of support for intersubjective meaning making
see [[connecting_levels_of_learning_in_networked_communities#preconditions_and_conditions_for_collaborative_learning|this]]

h3. Role of individual student learners
  * the individual mind is itself a social product, the result of interpersonal interactions
  * there are group knowledge-building processes not reducible to individual mental processes
  * a group can only build knowledge with the participation of individuals, to understand and collaborate

h3. Role of testing and assessment
  * Zone of Proximal Development - individual learning is different from group knowledge, children learn to do things in groups before they can do them as individuals
  * in addition to testing what individuals can do, we should test what they can achieve in groups working together (::how much of this is the result of the one specific group, which is context-specific and will not follow the students to the workplace etc, and how much of it gives a better idea of an individual's capacity in any group, which will be relevant when individual enters different groups in workplace?::)

h3. Role of technology
  * technology to support group interactions
  * people tried to design technologies in terms of technical issues, their solutions failed to be adopted and used because of social factors
  * innovative software concepts inspire researchers, funding sources and users

h2. Present: Alternative approaches within CSCL (multiple analytic voices)
h3. The theoretical divide
