h1. Technology-enhanced interactions analysis II

h2. Fostering Social Navigation and Elaboration of Controversial Topics with Preference-Inconsistent Recommendations
//Christina Schwind, Jurgen Buder, Friedrich W. Hesse//

  * elaborated opinion formation requires critical thinking

web seems ideal for this, BUT

psychological barrier
  * expectations afect information search
  * confirmation bias

recommender systems 
  * principle of maximum similarity (Munro, Hook and Benyon 1999)

confrontation with disagreeing others
  * stimulates conflict
  * leads to deeper elaboration

Assumptions
  * preference-inconsistent recommendations
    * reduce confirmation bias
    * lead to deeper thinking on controversial topics

Procedure
  * read introduction on controversial topic
  * indicate pre-preference
  * receive list of eight information sources

Conditions
  * control
  * consistent recommendation to pre-preference
  * non-consistent recommendation

All received same information, but the difference was the highlighting (none, consistent, non-consistent). Could only select one reading for further study.

Variables
  * confirmation bias
    * confirmation bias in two first, not in third. no difference between 1st and 2nd.
  * with third, attenuation of preference (first/post)
  * more novel arguments were introduced in the essay for non-consistent recommendations condition

h2. Adaptable Scripting in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning to Foster Knowledge and Skill Acquisition
//Xinghua Wang, [[:a:Ingo Kollar]], [[:a:Karsten Stegmann]], [[:a:Frank Fischer]]//

Collaboration scripts structure group interaction by specifying task, distributing roles, and sequencing sub-activities.

Follow up study of [@weinberger2003scripts].

Flexibility deals with the concerns of coercive scripting ([@tchounikine2007directions]), being too coercive, no room for self-regulation ([@diziol2009using]).

Adaptable scripting as a promising approach to realize self-regulation (Leutner 2009). Learners can switch on and off parts of script based on needs. 

look at how adaptable scripts help acquisition of
  * domain-specific skills
  * domain-independent skills

conditions
  * unscripted
  * non-adaptable
  * adaptable

environment
  * text-based chat, etc - like Weinberg 2003

phases
  * pre-test
  * training
  * chat
    * reflect on training, plan for treatment
    * learners in third condition can choose roles
    * treatment
      * learn attribution theory by applying theory to cases
    * post-test
      * performance on individual knowledge and skill acquisition
      * analyze new case applying theory
      * first 10 minutes individually
      * then chat with group
        * assess their use of collaboration skills

result
  * learner in adaptable scripted outperformed 1 and 2 (no significant difference between 1 and 2)

questions:
  * why did you do the learning phase? why not start right away?
    * we think learners need some previous knowledge about the script, otherwise they cannot adapt it
    * how about adaptability during training phase?
    * not very autonomous
  * anything about motivation?
    * some questionnaire, no difference
    * high or low?
    * relatively low, especially after the treatment
  * did you look at ability? i read that higher-level learners might use support even if they don't need it, lower-level learners won't know to use them? could exacerbate difference
    * have open question to measure learners' knowledge about collaboration
  * maybe split up the project in time, to keep the motivation higher

h2. Explaining the Effects of Continuous and Faded Scripts on Online Search Skills: The Role of Collaborative Strategy Practice
//[[:a:Christof Wecker]], [[:a:Ingo Kollar]], [[:a:Frank Fischer]]//, LMU

not just a "script effect" presentation (I have a script, and it works!), but trying to understand how it works

prepare learners to be responsible citizens who can participate in debates about socio-scientific issues

learners collaborative conduct online searches, collaboration script, inquiry unit

beneficial effects of collaboration scripts

during
  * trigger targeted activities
  * raise quality of discourse
  * enhance group products

after
  * domain-general skills

In previous research, faded scripts have not been inferior to continous scripts

Potential mechanisms of script internalization
  * what drives the development of domain-general skills when learning with a collaboration script?
    * mere exposure to script prompts?
      * in this case, their practice should not predict online search skills
    * own practice of the strategy suggested by script
      * the learners' own practice should predict outcome
    * observing learner partner's practice of strategy (social learning theory)
      * the learning partner's practice of skills should predict outcome

RQ:
  * effect of continuous and faded scripts on students' practice
  * how are students and learning partners' practice of strategy suggested by script related to their development of online search skills 

method
  * instructional unit: genetics
    * intro
    * economic aspect
    * ecological aspect
    * health aspect

used WISE platform to study genetics. three cycles focusing on different aspects. each cycle, three phases:

  * study of background info, through WISE (dyads)
  * collaborative online search, learners went to look for more detailed information which is up-to-date, collaboratively dyads sitting next to each other, with their own laptops, connected - whatever one person clicked on, was brought up on the other person's screen
  * plenary discussion, exchange arguments and information during collaborative online searches

conditions:
  * no script
  * continuous 
  * faded

script:
  * panel on the left side, showing complementary prompts, adapted according to stage of search
  * prompts were different for the two students
  * in faded, they gradually became less specific and finally went away

dependent:
  * online search skills (pre/post) - describe strategy for online search
  * practice of the strategy - recorded screens and dyad's discussions, first ten minutes from three search phases and coded for occurrence of activities
    * selecting a position
    * sketching an initial position to be backed up by online search

results:
  * better with script, no difference faded or not
  * practice of strategy, with script much better, continuous a bit better than faded
  * learning practices highly predicted online search skills, partners' did not

discussion:
  * practice of strategy lower than in laboratory studies (below 10%)
    * we are in field setting
    * was just one activity, we didn't expect activity to be 100%
  * pattern of effects on continuous and faded script on practice of the strategy mirrors pattern of effects on online search skills
  * mere exposure to script does not explain internalization
  * one's own practice does to some extent
  * observing one's partners does not
  * practice only explained a small percentage, must be other mechanisms

limitations
  * time limit, ten minutes
  * look only for a few activities

future research
  * ways to increase practice of strategy (also in field settings) cf Wecker & Fischer in press
  * Look for further explanatory variables for script internalization (e. g. mindfulness Salmon & Globerson, 1987)

Teachers should take care that collaboration scripts are actually followed.

h2. Conversational Strategies that Support Idea Generation Productivity in Groups
//Rohit Kumar, Jack Beuth, [[:a:Carolyn Penstein Rose]]//, CMU

design of tutor prompts for supporting collaborative learning
  * software agents that monitor interaction of students
    * social interaction strategies
    * presentation style of prompts

birds eye:
  * collaborative learning
  * small group communication (communication studies)
  * tutorial dialogue -> dialog systems -> conversational tutors

Kumar 2007 shows
  * benefit of collaborative learing
  * dynamic support 
  * combined

problems
  * students ignore/abuse agents
  * tutors unable to manage attention of the students  

Used [[:Basilica]] as system

Instrumental vs socio-emotional interaction

Interesting questions to ask:
  * significant benefits?
    * Kumar et al 2010 ITS
  * amount of social behaviour
    * Hua et al 2010 ITS
  * why/how & timing of behavior
    * Kumar & Rose 2011 SigDial
  * transfer to other domains
  * style of presentation
    * **this talk**

Presentation style
  * heteroglossia vs monoglossia
  * lexical/grammatical choices
  * indicates social positioning of the speaker

heteroglossia
  * awareness/acknowledgment of multiple perspectives
  * (more like a suggestion, than a command)
 
learning activity (study)
  * mechanical engineering course
  * design a better wrench
    * underlying concepts: moment, stress, strength
  * collaborative design lab
  * team of 3-4 students
  * communicate using concertchat
  * supported by automated tutors

metrics
  * learning outcomes
  * perception ratings (of tutor, task)
  * idea contributions (by students)
    * count using dictionary
      * how about, can we
      * increase, decrease, steel
    * noisy measure, only estimates
      * for all condition, no bias

results
  * no significant for learning
  * for perception, heteroglossic made students more happy, and perceived themselves as more happy
  * heteroglossic more perceived as "human-like"
  * better to use a consistent style
  * heteroglossic led to more idea generation
  * no relationship between learning and idea generation (unlike Wang 2007)

questions:
  * more ideas, but are they good or bad ideas?
    * even bad ideas are useful to learn the tradeoff involved in the design
  * more intervention was in the social aspect? task of the tutor is not just social, should support more cognitive, content-specific aspects?
    * constant across all conditions
    * you need cognitive, social and motivational aspects - three tasks of a tutor
