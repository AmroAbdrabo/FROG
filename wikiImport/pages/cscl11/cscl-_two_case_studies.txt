h1. CSCL- Two case studies

An alternative to the view of common ground based on convergence of mental models

h2. Seeing what we mean, co-experiencing a shared virtual world

  * Western metaphor of "seeing as knowing in a deep way" (analogy of the cave)
  * small infant and mother, pointing, looking at something together
  * case study, 3 students establish and maintain intersubjective understanding of a math problem, which they solve as a group

h3. Problem of intersubjectivity and common ground
  * intersubjectivity - how a group of people understand the same thing
  * precondition of collaborative learning is that participants understand each other enough to do their work
  * includes tacit background knowledge and explicit shared understanding of the current topic
  * in cognitive science, grounding of shared understanding is treated as the explicit comparisons of mental models or internal opinions, but we think it is the result of interactional work in which a shared world is created and various methods are used to ensure a sharing of this world

h3. Physically embodied being-in-the-world
  * we are all in a world
  * we learn about and experience the many dimensions of this world together, as mature social beings
  * the "problem" of establishing inter-subjectivity is a pseudo-problem in most cases
  * human existence is fundamentally intersubjective from the very beginning
  * a problem that arose in philosophy, because philosophers thought about things the wrong way

h3. Intersubjectivity in virtual world
  * you are not really embodied with other people
  * all you see is the computer screen

h4. Example of VMT
  * list of people - presence
  * chat: every posting starts with name of person
  * you get a sense of who individual people are, and how they view what is going on in the environment

h3. Practical issues of intersubjectivity online
  * how do people who met online create a shared world in which they can understand things the same?
  * how do their online actions (chat and drawing) build a joint problem space of actors, places, times and social relationships
  * how do they raise issues of understanding, repair misunderstandings, share personal perspectives
  * "joint problem-space" ([[:a:Jeremy Roschelle]])

h3. Research
  * choose small chat transcript, analyze it collaboratively as a team, line by line

h4. Analysis
  * someone invents a new term, how does the group get to understand this term, and use it as a common referent? (hexagonal array)
  * how do students use questions to establish intersubjectivity? (Nan Zhou looked at this)
  * students taking turns in making knowledge advances - not one person solving and explaining to others
  * moving back and forth between different representations (graphical, algebraic etc)

h3. Group cognition in math
  * open shared worl with external representation - joint problem space visually shared
  * orient everyone to specific object for mutual discussion
  * make a particular pattern visually relevant
  * discuss pattern in words
  * signify pattern in mathematical symbols and manipulate them
  * each participant understands the resources, methods and steps well enough to use them individually in the future
  * features and affordances of CSCL media and environment used to support intersubjectivity and group cognition:
    * persistent text chat
    * shared whiteboard
    * line color & thickness
    * pointing tool

h3. 3 units of analysis
  * individual
  * group
  * classroom: group posts results to wiki, shared with other groups - interaction between small groups

h3. Questions
  * from book: all individuals try to solve a problem, nobody are able to, then go into team, are able to

h2. How does group cognition take place and how can it be analyzed in a paradigmatic CSCL setting
  * hierarchy of level of temporal structure for online collaboration
  * sequential structure of collaborative math discourse
  * VMT case study
  * 10 discourse moves in detail
  * group cognition in math

h3. Hierarchy of structural layers
  * conversational topic (longer sequence)
  * discourse move (sequentical accomplishment built on elementary interchange)
  * adjacency pair (base interaction involving two or three utterances, which drives a discourse move)
  * textual utterance (a text chat posting by an individual participant, which may contribute to an adjacency pair)
  * indexical reference (an element of a textual utterance that points to a resource in the context)

h3. Longer sequences in CSCL
  * conversation analysis (Sacks, Schegloff), discourse analysis (Gee)
  * all verbal communication involves adjacency pairs -- how do small groups create knowledge together through "longer sequences"
  * conversation analysis focses on how people construct their interactions with turn taking and adjacency-pair
  * usually analyzes American adults in informal settings
  * needs to be adapted to online text chat

h2. Questions
  * Vygotsky said "people can solve problems in groups long before they can solve problems individually"
  * Someone should develop ways of testing groups of students
  * **How do you measure quality of collaboration, and avoid one person dominating the group?**
  * Coding based on different theories (I don't do that). Many people assign roles to avoid someone dominating. An adult in the chat room could be a facilitator. We had people in the chat, who were mainly answering questions about the technology. Intelligent agents. Visualize collaboration statistics to make students "self-police".
  * Stahl feels like humans are good at group processes, so just lets them "do their own thing". Works out over a period of time.
