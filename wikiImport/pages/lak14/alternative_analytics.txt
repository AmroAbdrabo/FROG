h1. Sleeper's lag: motion and attention
//Raca, Tormey, Dillenbourg//

  * Classroom activities - are they being followed
    * "with-me-ness"
  * Signals in the classroom
    * attention - following the lecture
  * Signal-oriented view of the classroom (signal-theory)
  * "Sleep-FL", FB pictures of students sleeping. 
  * Motion analysis. Intensitivity of movement. 

h3. Filters
  * annotated region
  * feature tracking (Lucas-Kanade)
  * motion tracks (heuristics)
  * gaussian probability to assign source of motion to a specific student

h3. Study
  * 4 cameras
  * questionnaires at 4 different points of time (attention, activities in that period)
  * want to capture
    * attention of student (normally distributed)
    * activities: 3 productive and 3 counter-productive

h3. Questions
  * teacher-centered positioning (further away from teacher)
  * student-centered positioning (proximics theory of E. T. Hall)
    * immediate neighboor
    * visible neighborhood
    * other

h3. Synchronization
  * borrowed from eye tracking
  * dyadic analysis of classroom - chronological correspondence of movement
    * immediate neighbor has higher probability of synchronization

Lag between synchronized movements in dyads higher for low-attention students. 

h1. Clustering of classroom visual displays
//Almeda and Baker//

No empirical evidence that large amounts of visual design supports learning - but can be described as "visual bombardment". May increase off-task behaviour among young children.

h1. Human data interpreters to close the feedback loop
//Doug Clow//

OU.UK: 3 million Moodle transactions per day. 

[[http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/innovating/|Innovating Pedagogy Report 2013]]

Institutional capacity building, 8 wranglers. Each working with specific faculty - ::kind of like faculty librarians::. 

h3. Data
  * student feedback
  * activity data (Moodle)
  * delivery data (what kind of course it is, which components that are used, how the incentives are structured for students)
  * completion, pass rates, demographic information

h3. Report process
  * briefing discussion
  * data analysis and report writing
  * draft discussion
  * final report

h3. Quality assurance
  * scrutiny in draft (internal peer-review, statistics etc)
  * standard document template
  * executive summary
  * recommendations ("more research required")
  * sometimes responsive quick reports, or doing extra in-depth work

Overwhelming finding: not much to see here. How can we streamline to things that are worth to look at regularly?

<blockquote>Only through detailed process of engagement and dialogue between analysts, stakeholders and the data, that insight and organisational change are developed.</blockquote>
