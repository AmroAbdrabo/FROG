h1. Convergr raw notes
 
  * continuing Suther's project - looking at CMaps, Mindmaps, KF, Compendium etc
  * relation to memory - spatial memory, memory palaces, etc also visual cognition chunking - each of the nodes is one chunk difference from KF where you have to click on nodes to see content experiments to see effect of various "chunk sizes" (a word, a sentence, an object) number of chunks/nodes on people's thinking (individual/collective)
  * nodes, links areas (like Tinderbox, use various areas to stamp nodes) - also possibility to provide various views/visualizations of the same info (like Tinderbox)
  * effect of screen size / resolution
  * effect of movement, interaction possibilities
  * research on learning in a graduate seminar as a "baseline" :)
  * effect of first starting in an empty view, vs starting in a view with some structure, vs first writing text and then having it displayed in the view
  * system for chat - also uses shapes and colors to distinguish type of contribution etc
  * possibility of dropping icons on each other, like iphone apps, create a new category, then using split screen write up a summary of that category - build upon
  * some kind of interface (sidebar, Diigo like) to extract key ideas from blog posts etc - use key ideas as mnemonics, easy to display context in many ways - both where they came from but also where post came from in timeline, links to other posts, etc
