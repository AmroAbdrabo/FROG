Inquiry-based learning on the web

WebQuest - much used in China, all prepared, teachers don't have to do much

The educational potential of games

How to make inquiry-based learning more game-like?

Game-based inquiry learning. Autonomous learning, collaborative inquiry, and conclusion.

Comparing GIL and normal web-based inquiry learning. Two classes, almost everything is the same, except for the approach. A website we developed ourselves, and a farming game (3d). Also have access to database, blog, forum and teacher instructions. 

In addition to data from the systems, also a test of knowledge, a test of attitude, and interviews with teachers and students. 

Game-based inquiry learning was more successful. Grades went both for both groups (because the next test was harder), but more for the control group.
