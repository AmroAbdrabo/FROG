h2. 3D Interactive Virtual Learning Environment
  * game - 3D graphics "peak of the game", virtual worlds or virtual environments
  * e-learning - LMS -> social network learning -> Second Life / Sloodle(::?::) (3D virtual learning environments) Clougherty (2009)

Problems 
  * to focused on fun, not appropriate for education
  * not open enough

So we developed our own environment
  * 3D modeling
  * virtual roles & interaction
    * name, movement, keyboard/mouse, API for other input devices, walk/fly/move
    * integrate with existing social website
  * 3D data compression

Plus 
  * educational theory
  * education technology

Results
  * physics simulation
    * Newton's first law of motion simulation (etc etc)
  * astronomy simulation
    * solar system simulation

Mostly just visual demonstrations, not much interaction by user, or freedom to explore. Also display of PPT and video.

::What is purpose of the social feature - multi-user etc?::

Using webcam for AR, bringing the examples from the virtual world into webcam with especially coded cards.
