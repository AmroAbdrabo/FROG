h2. Mobile and ubiquitous learning

h3. U-computing
  * computing with natural interfaces
  * context-aware computing
    * automated capture and access to live experience
    * everyday computing
    * able to sense personal behaviour in the real world
      * ease burden for students for findng leanring materials
      * support adaptive learning
      * guide learen in the real world
      * judge learner's behaviour in real world
      * hint student before something is going really wrong
      * (for example capture the experience of doing an experiment - like [[mixables_kyle_bowens|Kyle Bowen's DoubleTake]]

**Context-aware U-learning environment**

PDA + RFID reader, students study trees, butterflies, etc. 
QR code. 

h3. Most important ed-tech journals
Educational Technology & Society
Computers & Education
British Journal of Educational Technology
Innovations in Education and Teaching International
Education Technology Research & Development
Journal of Computer Assisted Learning

(number of u-learning journals increase year for year, mostly for science, math and language -- from 2006-2010 Taiwan had the most articles about m/u-learning, half written by author)

h3. Uses
  * As a guide around a museum, instead of sending the students out without any purpose. 
  * Training of nurses, put lots of RFID tags on the body of a kid, see if the nurse checks the right locations
  * Help learning how to analyze crystals in a laboratory (did you locate the crystal correctly, etc)
  * Help students appreciate culture and art, as opposed to big guided tours where students get bored and create trouble
    * help them read the classical characters, find online info, read stories about the history
  * Ecological investigations (1500 students each year)

h3. Research/findings
  * Lot's of data collection, pre- and post-tests, satisfaction etc. Very successful.
  * Advantage: immediate feedback.
  * Very large difference in how long it takes to train lab technicians, very large savings with u-learning.
