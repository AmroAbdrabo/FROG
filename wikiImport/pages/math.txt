Rudin's Analysis book is very good, so is Lang's Algebra [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5014399|Math notes to take you from one year of college calculus to grad student level | Hacker News]]

Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra textbook is designed to be useful to the self-learner, and I think the latest edition was revised after MIT's OCW was a thing, so actually references all the material online, IIRC.

My favorite book of this type is Shafarevich's Basic Notions of Algebra. [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5014399|Math notes to take you from one year of college calculus to grad student level | Hacker News]]

I'd like to say that Apostol's "Introduction to Analytic Number Theory" is bloody awful and is in no way suitable to be an introduction to analytic number theory. A reference book of proofs of some common theorems, yes, but an introduction? No. [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5014399|Math notes to take you from one year of college calculus to grad student level | Hacker News]]

An operation is commutative if the order of the operands don't matter. For instance, in ordinary maths it holds true that a + b = b + a, and therefore the + operation is commutative.


An operation is associative if the order of the operations don't matter. For instance, in ordinary maths if holds true that a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c, and therefore the · operation is associative.


On the other hand, division, for instance, is neither commutative nor associative. [[http://chrisvest.name/floating-point-addition-is-not-associative.html|chrisvest.name- Floating point addition is not associative]]
