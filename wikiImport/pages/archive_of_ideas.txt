h1. Archive of ideas

//I'm trying to make [[Ideas]] more targeted, linking to specific ideas I'd like to develop further, so I'm dumping the previous contents here, to edit in the future//



h2. Researchr
Tool that takes selected text and replaces all citekeys with proper citations, adds reference list, optionally as rich text (for GMail etc). Use RTF code from imfeelinglucky

h2. Analysis
automatically pull in everything said by people in CSCL intro: 
  * forum posts (pull in entire activity stream)
  * blog posts (fairly easy through RSS, although RSS doesn't cover all items retrospectively... also problem with comments)
  * etherpad - just need to connect names to utterances... how about analyzing editing of the collective pad? look at files generated on server
  * twitter (minimal)
just extract exactly what was typed, and timestamp. that way you can both show activity per student over time, and over different participation methods (nice visualizations), but you can also do LSA, word clouds etc -- see when a term was first introduced, and when it reappears (unlikely word combinations), see how word clouds change from one week to the next, etc.
