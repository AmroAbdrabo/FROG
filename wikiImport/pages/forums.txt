h1. Forums


----
Forums have been identified as an essential ingredient of an effective online course, providing the bulk of asynchronous communication and instructional interaction. They are thought to enhance networking opportunities and increase opportunities for consultation and collaboration with other professionals (Anderson & Kanuka, 1997). Significant in the success of online forums is the role of the instructor or moderator (Berge, 2006; Anderson & Kanuka, 1997). Salmon (2004) bases online learning and interaction on discussion forums. Within this widely established approach the role of the instructor or moderator is to weave, thread and respond regularly, posting new material, encouraging activities and discussions [so that] students respond with enthusiasm and regular participation.(Harasim, et al., 1995, p.43). p. 2

participation and interaction in forums is always based on establishing and maintaining comfort (in the technologies), and a supportive space within which people can try out and develop new skills, formulate tentative ideas, and become part of a community of inquiry. Trust is all too easily broken, and once broken, difficult to repair: what Barnett (2007) calls the fragility of the will to learn. If open networks are about building learning networks /communities, the fragility of the will to learn must inform network design and practice p. 3
