h1. Hacks

This page is to document some of the little tricks, hacks and scripts I've come up with. Most of this is inspired by, and heavily borrows from lot's of sources out there, so it's only fair to share it.

There are also some of my [[http://reganmian.net/blog/tools-and-hacks/|older projects on my blog]], I might eventually move them all here.

A quite big hack is my integration of BibDesk, DokuWiki and Skim to create an "academic workflow" / "personal knowledge management system" I call [[researchr:]].

h2. Mac integration
I've recently discovered AppleScript through Ruby, and have played with making little scripts that use a keyboard shortcut, Ruby and AppleScript together. 

All these scripts can generally be found in my github repository [[https://github.com/houshuang/folders2web|folders2web]], together with unfinished scripts. Most depend on a bit of tinkering to get them to work on your system.

  * [[Bibdesk]] - a great citation manager made better
  * [[Chrome autolinking]] - automatically look up and insert links, in different formats, using Google
  * [[Create PDFs with QuickLook]] - convert DOC, RTF and any file types that QuickLook accepts into PDFs from Finder

h3. Prerequisites
All of these tools are written in Ruby, simply because I am most comfortable with it. They can be found in this [[http://github.com/houshuang/folders2web|github collection]] (together with lot's of other half-baked scripts). 

h4. Appscript
[[http://appscript.sourceforge.net/|rb-appscript]] let's me talk to other Mac applications through AppleScript, and it has really changed how I do things -- I typically only need one or two lines of AppleScript in a script, and being able to write everything else in Ruby. The one disadvantage is that you have to convert from the AppleScript syntax to Appscript, which sometimes isn't obvious, and you end up with lines like these:<code ruby>
dt = app('Google Chrome')
url = dt.windows[1].get.tabs[dt.windows[1].get.active_tab_index.get].get.URL.get</code>
Which gives you the URL of the currently open tab in Chrome

I have tried to collect all my [[Appscript|Appscript snippets]].

h4. Growl
[[http://growl.info/|Growl]] is a tool that shows quick notifications. It's a great way for a command line tool to display information in a non-intrusive way. (I also use this for a kind of "menu"). If you have [[https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew|brew]], you can install the command line interface with <code>brew install growlnotify</code>

h4. Keyboard Maestro
I need to be able to launch my scripts using keyboard shortcuts. (I could also turn them into Services with [[http://wafflesoftware.net/thisservice/|ThisService]], and assign them keyboard shortcuts using the Control Panel). I use [[http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/|Keyboard Maestro]], which costs a little bit of money, but has been very useful so far. I really like the fact that I can isolate shortcuts to specific applications, so that for example Cmd+E does one thing in Skim, and another thing in Chrome.

What you’re looking for is probably ssh. It’s installed by default and opens an encrypted connection to a shell on a remote server. You probably know it. What you don’t know perhaps is that you can pipe stuff there:


cat File.markdown | ssh user@host markdown | less


Outsourcing computations to larger machines has been ingrained in the UNIX philosophy for quite a while now :) [[http://www.devthought.com/2012/03/13/bash-as-a-service/|Bash as a Service | Guillermo Rauch's Devthought]]
