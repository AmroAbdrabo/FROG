A MOOC is an online course with the option of free and open registration, a publicly shared curriculum, and open-ended outcomes. MOOCs integrate social networking, accessible online resources, and are facilitated by leading practitioners in the field of study. Most significantly, MOOCs build on the engagement of learners who self-organize their participation according to learning goals, prior knowledge and skills, and common interests.


Based on this discussion, we settled on the pedagogical model that continues to define MOOCs:


  * High levels of learner control over modes and places of interaction

  * Weekly synchronous sessions with facilitators and guest speakers

  * The Daily email newsletter as a regular contact point for course participants The Daily includes a summary of Moodle forums, course participant blogs, Twitter discussions related to the course, etc

  * Using RSS-harvesting (gRSShopper) to track blogs of course participants

  * Emphasis on learner autonomy in selecting learning resources and level of participation in activities

  * Emphasis on social systems as effective means for learners to self-organize and wayfinding through complex subject areas

  * The criticality of “creation” - ie learners create and share their understanding of the course topics through blogs, concept maps, videos, images podcasts. 

    * Creating a digital artifact helps learners to re-centre the course discussion to a more personal basis [[:Notes:Mcauley2010mooc]]

Across a range of Coursera classes, students watch a typical lecture video an average of 1.7 times, with one in every 10 students watching video more than 2.7 times on average. Given that the proportion of students who watch at least 90 percent of the available lecture videos is around twice the number of students who earn a Statement of Accomplishment, this important subpopulation cannot be ignored.
