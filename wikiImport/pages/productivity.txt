[[Getting Things Done]]

Willpower notes
  * "ego-depletion" - history from the Victorian era
  * willpower is like a muscle, can be depleted
  * relies on glucose, can be "refueled"
  * only one kind of willpower, people who held emotions in during movie more likely to snack afterwards, people who resisted snacking do more poorly on difficult puzzles
  * willpower - a muscle that can be trained, by doing many small and frequent exercises, like
    * not swearing
    * speaking in complete sentences (or always saying yes and no, not yeah)
    * correcting posture
  * when willpower (and glucose level) low
    * hard to make a decision
    * often revert to "easiest/safest" decision
    * time-horizon shortens, more likely to choose immediate gain
    * everything "intensified", feelings, cravings, etc
  * tricks
    * postponing pleasures instead of denying them entirely (if you feel like a chocolate, say "I will eat it in half an hour", and see if you still want it
      * in an experiment, people who postponed a snack later ate less in total than the people who ate it immediately
    * learning habits (see Duffig book)
      * people with a lot of willpower use it to establish habits that are automatic, and that avoid depleting willpower
    * changing routines and pre-commitment to avoid temptation
  * procrastination
    * detailed todo-lists with next actionable item (GTD)
    * removing the option to do something else - a set amount of time per day where you either have to work on your thesis, or not do anything
  * tracking, quantified self, weighing yourself every day, word count, etc. measuring and tracking, visualizing
  * If-then chain (very clear rules), if there are french fries at the buffet, I'm not going to take it
  * Clear lines - I will never do something - easy to track (but might make you crave stuff much more than postponing)
  * Writing down clear next steps - ending the "monkey chatter"... unfinished tasks really affect your mental space, but with written down clear next-steps, your subconscious "goes quiet"

Habits
  * habits consist of cue, action, reward
  * cues can be
    * immediately preceding action
    * time
    * location
    * mood?ou 
  * try to write down when you have a craving, etc, the possible cues, and "self-research" over time what your triggering cue is
  * also experiment with what the reward is, if you eat chocolate at 4PM every day, it might be because you need a break, fresh air, socializing, or more energy. 
  * trick is to identify the cue, change the action, and keep the reward
