h1. A Framework to Understand the Impact of Technology on Collaborative Learning

h1. Mobile Applications and Support of Collaborative Mathematical Activity in Families
//Roy D. Pea, Stanford University; Shelley V. Goldman, Stanford University; Kristen Pilner Blair, Stanford University; Osvaldo Jimenez, Stanford University//

How and when do families collaborate on math?
  * family as cultural context for doing math
  * design points of synergy - math at family and math at school
  * families are the first, effective learning settings
  * thought as a solitary endeavour - understand math as concerted activity and problem-solving
  * family as unit of analysis
  * math that families encounter in their daily life

23 families
  * interviewed at home
  * together choose a cell-phone plan

Findings
  * families learn and do math in a number of contexts
  * ongoing activities, home improvement, work, game play
  * math organized by problems they have to solve
  * problems tackled with resources that are ready at hand
  * difference between family math and school math
    * at school
      * math for math's sake
      * focus on one kind of math at a time
      * one correct solution, answer right or not, avoid error
      * evaluation by others
    * home
      * solving problems
      * multiple kinds of math
      * multiple solutions and levels of precisions
      * multiple solution attempts
      * self-perceived confidence, and being able to move on

Our environments need to
  * be driven by situations
  * promote enjoyment of math
  * demonstrate value of mathematizing experience
  * compelled by values
  * use family as a social unit
  * complement school 
  * use affordances of mobiles
  * based on family math research

Hypothesis: family interactions + mobile apps -> collaborations around math

Building on family communications
  * active and intimate participation
  * time spent together 
  * turn taking and conversational participation

Mobiles
  * short activity bursts
    * down-time play
    * families in each other's business
    * game-like features and problem solving
  * mobile affordances
    * anytime, anywhere
    * social uses

Go Roadtrip! (app)

Study tensions and findings
  * families eager to join study, yet find it difficult to organize study-related time on their own
  * access to phone not a given - apps are on mother's phone, doesn't want to give it to the kids
  * pre-survey of kids reveals view of math as solitary activity
  * kids mostly playing a certain of the games in the suite - the most game-like and fast-moving one

h1. I, Robot: An Embodied Action Adventure Story of Collaboration, Playing Robot, and Perspective Taking
//Carmen Julia Petrick, The University of Texas at Austin; Taylor Martin, The University of Texas - Austin; Matthew W. Berland, The University of Texas - San Antonio; Tom Benton, The University of Texas - Austin//

How does physical embodiment change the way students learn to program
  * actions
  * perspective taking

Literature review
  * Papert had kids who had problems with programming Turtle actually act out the path of the turtle (body syntonicity)
  * Act our programs vs imagine acting out programs (actually acting out - more complex programs in the future)
  * Physical robots vs virtual robots - physical robots more likely to take agent based, virtual robots more likely to take top-down perspective

Ideas
  * perspective taking
    * first person perspective, getting into the action
  * collaboration
    * 3rd person perspective
  * students need to be able to take information from one perspective to translate it to another context

IPRO - programming game, students program virtual robots to play soccer
  * mobile (iPod) - take their program with them
  * social - walk over and show my friend my code, etc.

Data
  * video
  * log data (every time they made a change)
  * student interview
  * pre/post-test

Analysis
  * case study of one specific student
  * sequence
    * talking to another student - 3rd person perspective
    * steps back, moving this way and that way, pretending to be the robot - 1st person
    * walks back over to Roger, explain change she has made, 3rd person

h1. Technological Support for Reflection and Discussion of What Counts as Math
//Lee Michael Martin, University of California - Davis; Pamela R. Gourley-Delaney, University of California - Davis//

h3. Study
Photo sort task

    * does it involve math or not?
    * disposable camera - take photos of math things
    * upload photos, caption and choose to share
    * view classmates' photos and comment on them
    * small group discussions
    * photo sort task again

h3. Findings
  * level of experience with an activity predicted students' judgment on whether that activity "involved math"
  * compared with undergraduate rations
  * variation in expansive or narrow stance on "what counts as math" - possibility vs necessity of math

h1. Collaborative Learning in a Multitouch Classroom
//Steven Edward Higgins, Durham University; Emma M. Mercier, Durham University; Elizabeth Louise Burd, Durham University//

Four multi-touch tables (MTT), easily send things between tables, from teacher to tables, or to the projector (networked).

Questions
  * how do tables support small-group collaborations
  * how does inter-group collaboration and whole classroom context work

Framework (for CSCL research/design)
  * technology
  * teams
  * tasks
  * teachers (could be more-expert peers, facilitators, something in the technology itself etc)

h3. Findings
Technology and teams
  * MTT: more joint attention, more quickly developed a joint problem space

Room orientation
  * more talk in centered room (and teachers didn't like it)
  * more correct answers in traditional room
  * BUT no difference in off-topic talk - they're talking more about the tasks, but not solving them any faster
  * maybe higher levels of participation in centered room, front-facing room leaving it to top two-three students

Teams & tasks
  * emergent roles
    * type of leadership that emerged during different tasks
    * person identified as leader changed from history to math tasks
    * more leadership moves during math than history (they know who is good at math)

Technology & teachers
  * really disliked separate desk in the front of the classroom, want to be able to walk around
  * group in front of the teacher table gets almost no attention from teacher
  * put it on an iPad, kind of liked it, still complained (don't like to hold onto something) 
  * looking into using Kinect to let teacher use gestures

Technology, team and tasks
  * within and between group math learning
  * nice examples of learning / getting spurred on from other group

Summary
  * multi-touch supports joint attention
  * room orientation changes interaction
  * content area influences emergent roles
  * access to teacher controls is an important feature of development work
  * within and between group learning

h1. A Technology Framework for Smart Classrooms and Knowledge Communities
//Mike Tissenbaum, University of Toronto; James D. Slotta, University of Toronto; Michelle Lui, OISE/University of Toronto//

  * discourse patterns
  * distributed expertise

  * KCI dimension
  * epistemological commitments
  * pedagogical affordances
  * technology elements
