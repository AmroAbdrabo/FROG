h1. Integrating Different Approaches to Investigating Self-Regulated Learning

h1. Introduction
//Matt Bernacki//

Winne & Hadwin (1998): Model of SRL

Aptitude approach
  * self-report
  * coarse grained measuring capacity or tendency (eg. help seeking in math)
  * long-term
  * longitudinal
  * self-reports can be misleading

Event based approach
  * trace methods (verbal, behavioral)
  * fine grained (behavior in context)
  * short term (minutes to hours)
  * single task context
  * can't measure what can't be observed, can't generalize

Framework
  * social - months to weeks to days
    * cognitive and meta capacities
    * behavioral tendencies
    * motivations
    * beliefs
    * dispositions
  * rational - hours to minutes
    * cognitive and metacognitive behaviors in task
    * planning
    * strategy use
    * monitoring
    * help-seeking
  * cognitive - seconds to milliseconds

Measuring SRL Winne & Perry 2000

h3. Aptitude measures
  * disadvantages
    * are they assessing domain-general learning tendencies rather than actual strategy-use
  * advantages
    * do these measures predict important learning outcomes?

h3. Research questions
  * how stable are the aptitude measures over two acdemic years
  * do they vary between English and math?
  * to what extent do organization, rehearsal and metacognitive SRL strategies predict achievement, motivation and behavior?

h3. Study
  * 9-11th grade girls high school in NYC

h3. Findings
English
  * rehearsal, some correlation
  * organization, negative predictor (why?)
  * SRL, strong correlation with English

Math
  * positive for rehearsal
  * negative for organization
  * positive for SRL

Self-report measures were quite stable

SRL strong positive predictor of achievement, adaptive motivation and behavior

h2. Extending Self-Regulated Learning to Include Self-Regulated Emotions
//Adar Ben-Eliyahu, University of Pittsburgh; Lisa Linnenbrink-Garcia, Duke University//

Emotions
  * high activation vs low activation
  * unpleasant vs pleasant

(Linnenbrink 2005, Russel, Feldman and Barrett 1999)

Question:
  * how does monitoring and adjusting of emotions with a learning situation occur 
  * different from outside a learning situation?
  * do students regulate emotions differently in favorite and least-favorite classes?

Self-regulated emotion strategies
  * reappraisal (positive) (John & Gross 2003)
  * suppression (negative) (John & Gross 2003)
  * rumination (depression) (Nolen-Hoeksema et al 1993)

Method: Survey

Future research
  * use online methods and facial affect to measure
  * longitudinal designs - diary studies

h2. Using Online Measures to Understand Self-Regulated Learning With Advanced Learning Technologies
//Roger Azevedo, McGill University; Jason Matthew Harley, McGill University; Reza Feyzi Behnagh, McGill University; François Bouchet, McGill University//

Interested in how self-regulatory processes are employed in real-time during the learning - SRL as an event

Trace methodologies - want to detect, track and model SRL during learning, problem solving and reasoning

Macro-level processes
  * cognitive
  * affective
  * metacognitive
  * motivational

Micro-level processes
  * relevant sub-goals, JOL, summarizing, bored, self-efficacy

Valence
  * negative and positive JOL(?)

Data:
  * process data
  * product data
  * self-report
  * other 
    * interface
    * learner-agent dialogue

Logs
  * time stamps, switching, time spent on different tasks
  * more difficult: reconstruction and classification of navigational paths
  * most difficult:
    * acquisition of and efficacy in the use of SRL during extended learning session
    * nature of learner-agents' dialogue to assess nature and quality of SRL and ERL
    * impact of agents' feedback and scaffolding on learners' self regulation

Huge amount of data - 65GB per participant

h2. Assessing Self-Regulated Learning: A (Meta)Cognitive Modeling Approach
//Vincent Aleven, Carnegie Mellon University; Ido Roll, The University of British Columbia; Bruce McLaren, Carnegie Mellon University; Kenneth R. Koedinger, Carnegie Mellon University//

  * math learning with an intelligent tutoring system
  * help students become better help seekers, and better learners
  * need to assess whether students use help well
  * production rule model captures effective and ineffective help seeking
  * automated assessment of help seeking

Geometry Cognitive tutor - used in hundreds of schools

Students can request help at any point (from the system - hints etc, multiple levels)

Help frequency correlates negatively with learning

Selection effect - bad learners will use help more frequently, and cause this statistics. Doesn't mean the bad learners would have done better without using help.

Computer-executable model of help-seeking
  * rational modeling
  * data-driven iteration
  * 83 production rules
  * action-by-action assessment of help seeking
  * compare each student action against actions the model takes in the same situation
  * build into tutor, give feedback on help-seeking as student is using the tool

Findings
  * lasting-improvement in help seeking behavior
  * no improvement in geometry learning

h2. Moderators of the Relation Between Self-Regulated Learning and Academic Performance: A Meta-Analysis 
//Amy L. Dent, Duke University; Harris M. Cooper, Duke University; Alison C. Koenka, Duke University//

Why academic performance?
  * most research focused on SRL as an outcome of psychological and contextual factors

Theoretical framework
  * 3 phases of metacognitive processes of SRL (emergent consensus)
    * preparation
      * goal setting
      * planning
    * performance
      * self-monitoring
      * self-control
    * appraisal
      * self-evaluation

Research questions
  * overall relation between achievement and definigin metacognitive processes of SRL
  * what theoretical and methodological factors moderate the strenght of this relation
  * theoretical
      * specific metacognitive processes
      * academic subject
      * students' grade level
      * gender
    * methodological
      * type or SRL measure
      * type of achievement measure

Assumption
  * online measures of SRL will produce stronger relation than offline measures to achievement
    * need to resoncstruct strategy use
    * effect of metacognitive knowledge
      * students with more nuanced strategy use might not endorse/report frequent typical strategies (their are better), and will be underreported

Meta-analysis allows for statistical integration of study outcomes across the literature
  * formulating problem
  * searching literature
    * full-text search of any mention of SRL, to make sure they didn't miss anything
  * gathering info from studies
  * statistically integrating study outcomes

Results
  * significant but small correlation between SRL and achievement
  * significantly differed by measure
    * online (n=15), quite strong
    * offline (n=60), much weaker 

Think-aloud had a higher correlation than other measures

properties of SRL enactments
  * learner perceives that there is a choice to modify conditions, operations and/or standards
  * environment affords choice
  * learner has choices to make
    * conditions that can be modified
    * repertoire of operations
    * diverse standards
  * regulation does not entail charge
    * long-term research program; replication is useful 
    * but we look for change, what happens when something doesn't change, might be on purpose
  * SRL evolves, need multiple samples of task engagement
  * SRL need not correlate or cause changes we value or expect
    * some experiments aren't productive (self-restriction to avoid feeling like a failure)
    * a learner's goal and standards may not match ours

Psychological features of SRL enactment
  * cue
  * goal or standard
    * attribute a learner uses to judge if a state optimizes 
  * tactic
    * operations a learner chooses
  * forecast
    * expectation of achievement
  * account
    * why they think this works
  * utility
    * cost/benefit ratio of a tactic/strategy
  * likelihood
    * probability of enactment by a learner
  * log
    * we have logs, but so do learners

Individual differences bearing on enactments of SRL
  * schema knowledge
    * structural features and qualities learner perceives about task and facets
  * focal task expertise
    * ability to do task now, versus having to build knowledge or skill
  * supporting task expertise
  * focal task drive
    * drive to success
  * epistemic sophistication
