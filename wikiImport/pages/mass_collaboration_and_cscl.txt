h1. Mass collaboration and CSCL


h2. Gerhard Fischer

learning, working and collaboration -> new learning organizations -> new media and new technologies

32. Problems transcending the individual human mind
problems of **magnitude**, which individuals, even large teams, cannot solve
  * Scratch
  * Wikipedia

problems of **systemic nature**, requiring collaboration of many different minds from variety of backgrounds
  * lifelong elarning
  * aging population
  * energy sustainability

Rich landscapes of learning (img)

Consumer culture -> culture of participation, provide all people with the means to participate actively in **personally meaningful** problems, citing Benkler and Tapscott.

h2. Drawbacks
  * participation overload
    * DIY societies
    * companies offloading work to customers
  * accumulation of irrelevant information
  * lack of coherent voices (-> fragmented cultures)

h2. MOOCs
Develop assessment of MOOCs from LS perspective. Identify core competencies of residential, research-based universities.

h2. Conclusions
  * cultures of participation
    * enrich the landscape of learning
  * by representing
    * fundamental opportunities, challenges and transformative changes
  * for
    * innovative theoretical foundations and systematic development
  * in learning sciences in general and CSCL specifically

h2. Systemic and cognitive perspective
  * individual = cognitive system
  * autopoeietic: exists through own operations
  * operations = thinking
  * operationally closed: thoughts build on thoughts
  * can be stimulated by the environment
  * processes information
  * system can assimilate/accomodate

  * Community as a social system: autopoietic & closed (not cognitive system)
  * operates through communication, syntehsis of message, information & understanding
  * develops own conventions, social norms, rules
  * information processing: what becomes central, influential, what dies out?
  * can be stimulated by the environment

Coupling between social system and cognitive systems. Each can provide environment for the other, stimulate each other -> leads to individual learning and collaborative knowledge construction. 

h2. Experiments based on co-evolution model
  * How does social system process information?
  * How does it make use of the individual cognitive systems?
