h1. Scholarly Communications


----
Scholarly publishing practices – especially those related to electronic publishing – are rapidly evolving and have not yet formed stable configurations. The cacophonous discourse about electronic publishing as a means of scholarly communication can be thematized around a series of issues that “are in the talk” as much as “in the published literature”: legitimacy of electronic publishing [@kling1999scholarly]
----
Scholarly communication is an umbrella term used to describe the process of academics, scholars and researchers sharing and publishing their research findings so that they are available to the wider academic community (such as university academics) and beyond.
